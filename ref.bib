  abstract = "Summary Immune cells in the tumor microenvironment modulate cancer progression and are attractive therapeutic targets. Macrophages and T cells are key components of the microenvironment, yet their phenotypes and relationships in this ecosystem and to clinical outcomes are ill defined. We used mass cytometry with extensive antibody panels to perform in-depth immune profiling of samples from 73 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients and five healthy controls. In 3.5 million measured cells, we identified 17 tumor-associated macrophage phenotypes, 22 T cell phenotypes, and a distinct immune composition correlated with progression-free survival, thereby presenting an in-depth human atlas of the immune tumor microenvironment in this disease. This study revealed potential biomarkers and targets for immunotherapy development and validated tools that can be used for immune profiling of other tumor types."

	abstract = {Tumors harbor multiple cell types that are thought to play a role in the development of resistance to drug treatments. Tirosh et al. used single-cell sequencing to investigate the distribution of these differing genetic profiles within melanomas. Many cells harbored heterogeneous genetic programs that reflected two different states of genetic expression, one of which was linked to resistance development. Following drug treatment, the resistance-linked expression state was found at a much higher level. Furthermore, the environment of the melanoma cells affected their gene expression programs.Science, this issue p. 189To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},

We describe a prospective, observational clinical study performed within the Tumor Profiler (TuPro) Consortium that aims to show the extent to which such comprehensive information leads to advanced mechanistic insights of a patient{\textquoteright}s tumor, enables prognostic and predictive biomarker discovery, and has the potential to support clinical decision making. For this study of melanoma, ovarian carcinoma, and acute myeloid leukemia tumors, in addition to the emerging standard diagnostic approaches of targeted NGS panel sequencing and digital pathology, we perform extensive characterization using the following exploratory technologies: single-cell genomics and transcriptomics, proteotyping, CyTOF, imaging CyTOF, pharmacoscopy, and 4i drug response profiling (4i DRP). In this work, we outline the aims of the TuPro study and present preliminary results on the feasibility of using these technologies in clinical practice showcasing the power of an integrative multi-modal and functional approach for understanding a tumor{\textquoteright}s underlying biology and for clinical decision support.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Clinical TrialBASEC-Nr.2018-02050Funding StatementThe study described in this paper is the result of a jointly-funded effort between several academic institutions (The University of Zurich, The University of Zurich Hospital, The Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, The University of Basel Hospital, and The University of Basel), as well as F.

Cardelino flexibly integrates information from imperfect clonal trees inferred based on bulk exome-seq data, and sparse variant alleles expressed in scRNA-seq data. We apply cardelino to a published cancer dataset and to newly generated matched scRNA-seq and exome-seq data from 32 human dermal fibroblast lines, identifying hundreds of differentially expressed genes between cells from different somatic clones. These genes are frequently enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways, indicating a role for cell division genes in somatic evolution in healthy skin.},

	abstract = {Single-cell multi-omics data provide a comprehensive molecular view of cells. However, single-cell multi-omics datasets consist of unpaired cells measured with distinct unmatched features across modalities, making data integration challenging. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, termed UnionCom, for the unsupervised topological alignment of single-cell multi-omics integration. UnionCom does not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features. It first embeds the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of each single-cell dataset into a distance matrix of cells within the same dataset and then aligns the cells across single-cell multi-omics datasets by matching the distance matrices via a matrix optimization method. Finally, it projects the distinct unmatched features across single-cell datasets into a common embedding space for feature comparability of the aligned cells. To match the complex nonlinear geometrical distorted low-dimensional structures across datasets, UnionCom proposes and adjusts a global scaling parameter on distance matrices for aligning similar topological structures. It does not require one-to-one correspondence among cells across datasets, and it can accommodate samples with dataset-specific cell types. UnionCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real single-cell multi-omics datasets. UnionCom is robust to parameter choices, as well as subsampling of features. UnionCom software is available at https://github.com/caokai1073/UnionCom.},

We here present an approach for integrating vastly different modalities by learning a probabilistic coupling between the different data modalities using autoencoders to map to a shared latent space. We validate this approach by integrating single-cell RNA-seq and chromatin images to identify distinct sub-populations of human naive CD4+ T-cells that are poised for activation. Collectively, our approach provides a framework to integrate and translate between data modalities that cannot yet be measured within the same cell for diverse applications in biomedical discovery.},

                   inference and learning algorithm that scales to large
                   datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions,
                   even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is
                   two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the
                   variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that
                   can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic

                   inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an

                   subclass of generative models. Despite a very rich research
                   activity leading to numerous interesting GAN algorithms, it
                   is still very hard to assess which algorithm(s) perform
                   better than others. We conduct a neutral, multi-faceted
                   large-scale empirical study on state-of-the art models and
                   evaluation measures. We find that most models can reach
                   similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and
                   random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise
                   from a higher computational budget and tuning more than
                   fundamental algorithmic changes. To overcome some
                   limitations of the current metrics, we also propose several
                   data sets on which precision and recall can be computed. Our
                   experimental results suggest that future GAN research should
                   be based on more systematic and objective evaluation
                   procedures. Finally, we did not find evidence that any of
                   the tested algorithms consistently outperforms the

  title         = "{GANs} Trained by a Two {Time-Scale} Update Rule Converge to
                   a Local Nash Equilibrium",

  abstract      = "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) excel at creating
                   realistic images with complex models for which maximum
                   likelihood is infeasible. However, the convergence of GAN
                   training has still not been proved. We propose a two
                   time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with
                   stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions.
                   TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the
                   discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of
                   stochastic approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges
                   under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash
                   equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular
                   Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the
                   dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat
                   minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the
                   performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the
                   ``Fr\textbackslash'echet Inception Distance'' (FID) which
                   captures the similarity of generated images to real ones
                   better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR
                   improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs

We therefore performed a comprehensive assessment of human bone marrow cells using both single-cell RNA sequencing and multiparameter flow cytometry from 20 healthy adult human donors across a broad age range. These data characterize variation between healthy donors as well as age-associated changes in cell population frequencies. Direct comparison of techniques revealed discrepancy in the quantification of T lymphocyte and natural killer cell populations. Orthogonal validation of immunophenotyping using mass cytometry demonstrated a strong correlation with flow cytometry. Technical replicates using single-cell RNA sequencing matched robustly, while biological replicates showed variation. Given the increasing use of single-cell technologies in translational research, this resource serves as an important reference data set and highlights opportunities for further refinement.},

  abstract = "Summary
  The advent of mass cytometry increased the number of parameters measured at the single-cell level while decreasing the extent of crosstalk between channels relative to dye-based flow cytometry. Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels. We performed an in-depth characterization of the spillover properties in mass cytometry, including limitations defined by the linear range of the mass cytometer and the reproducibility of the spillover over time and across machines. We demonstrated the utility of our method in suspension and imaging mass cytometry. To conclude, our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype artifacts."
