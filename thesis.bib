  abstract = {We introduce the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) as the classification function in a deep neural network (DNN). Conventionally, ReLU is used as an activation function in DNNs, with Softmax function as their classification function. However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer \$h\_\{n - 1\}\$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters \$\textbackslash theta\$ to get the raw scores \$o\_\{i\}\$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores \$o\_\{i\}\$ by \$0\$, i.e. \$f(o) = \textbackslash max(0, o\_\{i\})\$, where \$f(o)\$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions \$\textbackslash hat\{y\}\$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax \$f(x)\$.},

A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks.},

A typical approach to solving this optimization problem relies on its connection to the dynamic formulation of optimal transport and the celebrated Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme. However, this formulation involves optimization over convex functions, which is challenging, especially in high dimensions. In this work, we propose an approach that relies on the recently introduced input-convex neural networks (ICNN) to parametrize the space of convex functions in order to approximate the JKO scheme, as well as in designing functionals over measures that enjoy convergence guarantees. We derive a computationally efficient implementation of this JKO-ICNN framework and experimentally demonstrate its feasibility and validity in approximating solutions of low-dimensional partial differential equations with known solutions. We also demonstrate its viability in high-dimensional applications through an experiment in controlled generation for molecular discovery.},

These are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural networks with constraints on the network parameters such that the output of the network is a convex function of (some of) the inputs. The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.},

However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi‐Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi‐omics data sets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex~vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy‐chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single‐cell multi‐omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

This existence of equilibrium inspires MIX+GAN protocol, which can be combined with any existing GAN training, and empirically shown to improve some of them.}

It is thought that these distinct phenotypes are plastic in nature and that their transcriptional reprogramming enables heterogeneous tumours both to undergo different stages of melanoma progression and to adjust to drug exposure during treatment. Recent advances in genomic technologies and the rapidly expanding availability of large gene expression datasets have allowed for a refined definition of the gene signatures that characterize these phenotypes and have revealed that phenotype plasticity plays a major role in the resistance to both targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In this Review we discuss the definition of melanoma phenotypes through particular transcriptional states and reveal the prognostic relevance of the related gene expression signatures. We review how the establishment of phenotypes is controlled and which roles phenotype plasticity plays in melanoma development and therapy. Because phenotype plasticity in melanoma bears a great resemblance to epithelial–mesenchymal transition, the lessons learned from melanoma will also benefit our understanding of other cancer types.},

  abstract = {The understanding of the tumor microenvironment (TME) has been expanding in recent years in the context of interactions among different cell types, through direct cell–cell communication as well as through soluble factors. It has become evident that the development of a successful antitumor response depends on several TME factors. In this context, the number, type, and subsets of immune cells, as well as the functionality, memory, and exhaustion state of leukocytes are key factors of the TME. Both the presence and functionality of immune cells, in particular T cells, are regulated by cellular and soluble factors of the TME. In this regard, one fundamental reason for failure of antitumor responses is hijacked immune cells, which contribute to the immunosuppressive TME in multiple ways. Specifically, reactive oxygen species (ROS), metabolites, and anti-inflammatory cytokines have central roles in generating an immunosuppressive TME. In this review, we focused on recent developments in the immune cell constituents of the TME, and the micromilieu control of antitumor responses. Furthermore, we highlighted the current challenges of T cell-based immunotherapies and potential future strategies to consider for strengthening their effectiveness.},

The instrument is based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry and comprises a three-aperture plasma-vacuum interface, a dc quadrupole turning optics for decoupling ions from neutral components, an rf quadrupole ion guide discriminating against low-mass dominant plasma ions, a point-to-parallel focusing dc quadrupole doublet, an orthogonal acceleration reflectron analyzer, a discrete dynode fast ion detector, and an 8-bit 1 GHz digitizer. A high spectrum generation frequency of 76.8 kHz provides capability for collecting multiple spectra from each particle-induced transient ion cloud, typically of 200-300 micros duration. It is shown that the transients can be resolved and characterized individually at a peak frequency of 1100 particles per second. Design considerations and optimization data are presented. The figures of merit of the instrument are measured under standard inductively coupled plasma (ICP) operating conditions ({$<$}3\% cerium oxide ratio). At mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) M/DeltaM {$>$} 900 for m/z = 159, the sensitivity with a standard sample introduction system of {$>$}1.4 x 10(8) ion counts per second per mg L(-1) of Tb and an abundance sensitivity of (6 x 10(-4))-(1.4 x 10(-3)) (trailing and leading masses, respectively) are shown.

Using image-based transcriptomics in millions of single human cells, we find that while variability of cytoplasmic transcript abundance is large, it is for most genes minimally stochastic and can be predicted with multivariate models of the phenotypic state and population context of single cells. Computational multiplexing of these predictive signatures across hundreds of genes revealed a complex regulatory system that controls the observed variability of transcript abundance between individual cells. Mathematical modeling and experimental validation show that nuclear retention and transport of transcripts between the nucleus and the cytoplasm is central to buffering stochastic transcriptional fluctuations in mammalian gene expression. Our work indicates that cellular compartmentalization confines transcriptional noise to the nucleus, thereby preventing it from interfering with the control of single-cell transcript abundance in the cytoplasm.},

The signaling behavior of cell subsets spanning a defined hematopoietic hierarchy was monitored with 18 simultaneous markers of functional signaling states perturbed by a set of ex vivo stimuli and inhibitors. The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

To study the regulatory networks, we targeted 1,354 human genes and screened for morphological changes of nucleoli, Cajal bodies, splicing speckles, PML nuclear bodies (PML-NBs), cytoplasmic processing bodies, and stress granules. By multivariate analysis of MLO features we identified hundreds of genes that control MLO homeostasis. We discovered regulatory crosstalk between MLOs, and mapped hierarchical interactions between aberrant MLO states and cellular properties. We provide evidence that perturbation of pre-mRNA splicing results in stress granule formation and reveal that PML-NB abundance influences DNA replication rates and that PML-NBs are in turn controlled by HIP kinases. Together, our comprehensive dataset is an unprecedented resource for deciphering the regulation and biological functions of MLOs.},

  abstract = {RNA velocity has opened up new ways of studying cellular differentiation in single-cell RNA-sequencing data. It describes the rate of gene expression change for an individual gene at a given time point based on the ratio of its spliced and unspliced messenger RNA (mRNA). However, errors in velocity estimates arise if the central assumptions of a common splicing rate and the observation of the full splicing dynamics with steady-state mRNA levels are violated. Here we present scVelo, a method that overcomes these limitations by solving the full transcriptional dynamics of splicing kinetics using a likelihood-based dynamical model. This generalizes RNA velocity to systems with transient cell states, which are common in development and in response to perturbations. We apply scVelo to disentangling subpopulation kinetics in neurogenesis and pancreatic endocrinogenesis. We infer gene-specific rates of transcription, splicing and degradation, recover each cell’s position in the underlying differentiation processes and detect putative driver genes. scVelo will facilitate the study of lineage decisions and gene regulation.},

MM-PSN identified patient subgroups not previously described defined by specific patterns of alterations, enriched for specific gene vulnerabilities, and associated with potential therapeutic options. Our analysis revealed that co-occurrence of t(4;14) and 1q gain identified patients at significantly higher risk of relapse and shorter survival as compared to t(4;14) as a single lesion. Furthermore, our results show that 1q gain is the most important single lesion conferring high risk of relapse and that it can improve on the current International Staging Systems (ISS and R-ISS).},

Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.},

Here we leverage the theory of optimal transport and the recent advent of input convex neural architectures to present CellOT, a framework for learning the response of individual cells to a given perturbation by mapping these unpaired distributions. CellOT outperforms current methods at predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein-imaging technology. Further, we illustrate that CellOT generalizes well on unseen settings by (1) predicting the scRNA-seq responses of holdout patients with lupus exposed to interferon-β and patients with glioblastoma to panobinostat; (2) inferring lipopolysaccharide responses across different species; and (3) modeling the hematopoietic developmental trajectories of different subpopulations.},

This likelihood estimate can be used to identify cell populations specifically affected by a perturbation. We also develop vertex frequency clustering to extract populations of affected cells at the level of granularity that matches the perturbation response. The accuracy of our algorithm at identifying clusters of cells that are enriched or depleted in each condition is, on average, 57\% higher than the next-best-performing algorithm tested. Gene signatures derived from these clusters are more accurate than those of six alternative algorithms in ground truth comparisons.},

A spatial metric for individual cells in scRNA-seq data is first established based on a map connecting it with the spatial measurements. The cell–cell communications are then obtained by “optimally transporting” signal senders to target signal receivers in space. Using partial information decomposition, we next compute the intercellular gene–gene information flow to estimate the spatial regulations between genes across cells. Four datasets are employed for cross-validation of spatial gene expression prediction and comparison to known cell–cell communications. SpaOTsc has broader applications, both in integrating non-spatial single-cell measurements with spatial data, and directly in spatial single-cell transcriptomics data to reconstruct spatial cellular dynamics in tissues.},

However, single-cell multi-omics datasets consist of unpaired cells measured with distinct unmatched features across modalities, making data integration challenging. In this study, we present a novel algorithm, termed UnionCom, for the unsupervised topological alignment of single-cell multi-omics integration. UnionCom does not require any correspondence information, either among cells or among features. It first embeds the intrinsic low-dimensional structure of each single-cell dataset into a distance matrix of cells within the same dataset and then aligns the cells across single-cell multi-omics datasets by matching the distance matrices via a matrix optimization method. Finally, it projects the distinct unmatched features across single-cell datasets into a common embedding space for feature comparability of the aligned cells. To match the complex nonlinear geometrical distorted low-dimensional structures across datasets, UnionCom proposes and adjusts a global scaling parameter on distance matrices for aligning similar topological structures. It does not require one-to-one correspondence among cells across datasets, and it can accommodate samples with dataset-specific cell types. UnionCom outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both simulated and real single-cell multi-omics datasets. UnionCom is robust to parameter choices, as well as subsampling of features.

Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

  abstract = {The RAS-regulated RAF–MEK–ERK signalling pathway transmits signals from growth factor receptors to the nucleus and other organelles to regulate cell proliferation, differentiation, survival and invasion.ERK pathway architecture places MEK1 and MEK2 in a unique position, where they process inputs from multiple upstream activating kinases so that ERK1 and ERK2 may be activated alone (following RAF activation) or together with other kinases such as JNK or p38.The majority of cancers exhibit hyper-activation of the ERK pathway owing to deregulation (mutation, gene fusions, amplification, and so on) of receptor tyrosine kinases, RAS, BRAF, CRAF, MEK1 or MEK2 or owing to the loss of negative pathway regulators, such as dual-specificity phosphatases (DUSPs) and NF1. In many cases, these mutations confer a range of pathway dependencies including classical 'oncogene addiction', providing a rationale for ERK pathway inhibitors as therapeutic agents.Melanomas carrying the mutation encoding BRAF-V600E are almost invariably addicted to BRAF activity, and first-generation BRAF inhibitors (BRAFis) have transformed the treatment of this disease. However, an inability to inhibit signalling by RAF dimers drives acquired resistance, and paradoxical RAF activation in tumours with wild-type BRAF limits the success or wider application of BRAFis.As RAF signalling proceeds via the activation of MEK1 and MEK2, and RAF-addicted tumour cells are also MEK-addicted, MEK1 and MEK2 are also attractive drug targets. Additionally, MEK1 and MEK2 contain a unique hydrophobic pocket adjacent to their ATP-binding site, which allows the binding of potent, non-ATP competitive, allosteric inhibitors. However, MEK1 and MEK2 are rarely mutated in cancer, so MEK inhibitors (MEKis) will not preferentially inhibit MEK1 and MEK2 in tumour cells compared with normal tissue; this may contribute to normal tissue toxicity.The first MEKi to receive US Food and Drug Administration approval, trametinib, is being used to treat BRAF-mutant melanoma in combination with first-generation BRAFis. A range of additional MEKis are in late-stage clinical development and exhibit various modes of action; for example, some MEKis can prevent the phosphorylation of MEK1 and MEK2 by RAF, and others can disrupt RAF–MEK1/MEK2 complexes. The extent to which these properties influence clinical activity is currently unclear.Factors that limit the efficacy of MEKis include loss of feedback inhibition and consequent reactivation of ERK1 and ERK2. Intrinsic resistance can be driven by the activation of parallel pathways, including the PI3K pathway, whereas acquired resistance to MEKis arises through the emergence of mutations in MEK1 or MEK2 or the amplification of BRAFV600E or mutant RAS.Adaptation and resistance to MEKis can be overcome by combinations with other targeted agents, including intrapathway dual inhibition. Clinical trials assessing MEKis in combination with other targeted agents or conventional chemotherapy are ongoing.},

  abstract = {Control of complex systems involves both system identification and controller design. Deep neural networks have proven to be successful in many identification tasks, however, from model-based control perspective, these networks are difficult to work with because they are typically nonlinear and nonconvex. Therefore many systems are still identified and controlled based on simple linear models despite their poor representation capability. In this paper we bridge the gap between model accuracy and control tractability faced by neural networks, by explicitly constructing networks that are convex with respect to their inputs. We show that these input convex networks can be trained to obtain accurate models of complex physical systems. In particular, we design input convex recurrent neural networks to capture temporal behavior of dynamical systems. Then optimal controllers can be achieved via solving a convex model predictive control problem. Experiment results demonstrate the good potential of the proposed input convex neural network based approach in a variety of control applications. In particular we show that in the MuJoCo locomotion tasks, we could achieve over 10\% higher performance using 5 times less time compared with state-of-the-art model-based reinforcement learning method; and in the building HVAC control example, our method achieved up to 20\% energy reduction compared with classic linear models.},

However, new mathematical and computational methods are required to represent and analyze gene-expression changes that occur in complex mixtures of single cells as they respond to signals, drugs, or disease states. Here, we introduce a mathematical modeling platform, PopAlign, that automatically identifies subpopulations of cells within a heterogeneous mixture and tracks gene-expression and cell-abundance changes across subpopulations by constructing and comparing probabilistic models. Probabilistic models provide a low-error, compressed representation of single-cell data that enables efficient large-scale computations. We apply PopAlign to analyze the impact of 40 different immunomodulatory compounds on a heterogeneous population of donor-derived human immune cells as well as patient-specific disease signatures in multiple myeloma. PopAlign scales to comparisons involving tens to hundreds of samples, enabling large-scale studies of natural and engineered cell populations as they respond to drugs, signals, or physiological change.},

  abstract = {Approximately one-half of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanomas harbor a mutation in the BRAF gene, with V600E being the most common mutation. Targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors is associated with significant long-term treatment benefit in patients with BRAF V600-mutated melanoma. Therefore, molecular testing for BRAF mutations is a priority in determining the course of therapy. A literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed and scientific congress databases using the terms ‘BRAF,’ ‘mutation,’ and ‘cancer/tumor.’ These results were filtered to include manuscripts that focused on diagnostic tests for determining BRAF mutation status. Numerous BRAF testing methods were identified, including DNA-based companion diagnostic tests and DNA- and protein-based laboratory-developed tests. Herein we review the characteristics of each method and highlight the strengths and weaknesses that should be considered before use and when interpreting results for each patient. Molecular profiling has shown that mutation load increases with melanoma tumor progression and that unique patterns of genetic changes and evolutionary trajectories for different melanoma subtypes can occur. Discordance in the BRAF mutational status between primary and metastatic lesions, as well as intratumoral heterogeneity, is known to occur. Additionally, the development of acquired resistance to combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy is still a formidable obstacle. Therefore, tumor heterogeneity and the development of acquired resistance have important implications for molecular testing and ultimately the treatment of patients with advanced-stage melanoma. Overall, this information may help community oncologists more accurately and effectively interpret results of diagnostic tests within the context of recent data characterizing melanoma tumor progression.},

Although reduced, spillover still exists in mass cytometry data, and minimizing its effect requires considerable expert knowledge and substantial experimental effort. Here, we describe a novel bead-based compensation workflow and R-based software that estimates and corrects for interference between channels. We performed an in-depth characterization of the spillover properties in mass cytometry, including limitations defined by the linear range of the mass cytometer and the reproducibility of the spillover over time and across machines. We demonstrated the utility of our method in suspension and imaging mass cytometry. To conclude, our approach greatly simplifies the development of new antibody panels, increases flexibility for antibody-metal pairing, opens the way to using less pure isotopes, and improves overall data quality, thereby reducing the risk of reporting cell phenotype artifacts.},

We propose in this work a new family of optimal transportation distances that look at transportation problems from a maximum-entropy perspective. We smooth the classical optimal transportation problem with an entropic regularization term, and show that the resulting optimum is also a distance which can be computed through Sinkhorn's matrix scaling algorithm at a speed that is several orders of magnitude faster than that of transportation solvers. We also report improved performance on the MNIST benchmark problem over competing distances.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: One of the most common and deadly complications of melanoma is brain metastases. The outcomes of advanced melanoma patients who developed brain metastases were reviewed to identify significant prognostic factors for overall survival (OS). METHODS: An institutional database of advanced melanoma patients enrolled on clinical trials in the Department of Melanoma Medical Oncology from 1986 to 2004 was reviewed and patients who developed brain metastases were identified. Date of diagnosis, patient age, pattern of brain involvement, timing relative to extracranial metastases, prior response to systemic therapy, and treatments given for brain metastases were assessed as potential prognostic factors for OS. RESULTS: Among 743 melanoma patients enrolled in clinical trials for regional or systemic metastatic disease, 330 (44\%) patients developed brain metastases. The median OS after the diagnosis of brain metastases was 4.7 months. Diagnosis before 1996, increased number of parenchymal brain metastases, leptomeningeal involvement, and development of brain metastases after receiving systemic therapy for extracranial metastases were found to be significant prognostic factors for OS. Among patients who received systemic therapy as the initial treatment of brain metastases, patients who previously responded to systemic therapies had longer survival than patients who had not responded. CONCLUSIONS: The era, pattern, and timing of melanoma brain metastases were found to be strongly associated with survival. Previous responsiveness to systemic therapies did not predict better outcomes overall, but it did correlate with improved survival for patients with brain metastases who were treated with systemic therapies. These factors may be used in guiding patient management and for stratifying patients in clinical trials.},

In this scenario, computational integration of multi-omic measurements is crucial to enable joint analyses. This integration task is particularly challenging due to the lack of sample-wise or feature-wise correspondences. We present single-cell alignment with optimal transport (SCOT), an unsupervised algorithm that uses the Gromov-Wasserstein optimal transport to align single-cell multi-omics data sets. SCOT performs on par with the current state-of-the-art unsupervised alignment methods, is faster, and requires tuning of fewer hyperparameters. More importantly, SCOT uses a self-tuning heuristic to guide hyperparameter selection based on the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. Thus, in the fully unsupervised setting, SCOT aligns single-cell data sets better than the existing methods without requiring any orthogonal correspondence information.},

We created cellHarmony, an integrated solution for the unsupervised analysis, classification, and comparison of cell types from diverse single-cell RNA-Seq datasets. cellHarmony efficiently and accurately matches single-cell transcriptomes using a community-clustering and alignment strategy to compute differences in cell-type specific gene expression over potentially dozens of cell populations. Such transcriptional differences are used to automatically identify distinct and shared gene programs among cell-types and identify impacted pathways and transcriptional regulatory networks to understand the impact of perturbations at a systems level. cellHarmony is implemented as a python package and as an integrated workflow within the software AltAnalyze. We demonstrate that cellHarmony has improved or equivalent performance to alternative label projection methods, is able to identify the likely cellular origins of malignant states, stratify patients into clinical disease subtypes from identified gene programs, resolve discrete disease networks impacting specific cell-types, and illuminate therapeutic mechanisms. Thus, this approach holds tremendous promise in revealing the molecular and cellular origins of complex disease.}

We demonstrate the utility of Vision in several case studies and show that it can derive important sources of cellular variation and link them to experimental meta-data even with relatively homogeneous sets of cells.

Unlike recent language representation models, BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5\% (7.7\% point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7\% (4.6\% absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).},

We demonstrate Perturb-seq by analyzing 200,000 cells in immune cells and cell lines, focusing on transcription factors regulating the response of dendritic cells to lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Perturb-seq accurately identifies individual gene targets, gene signatures, and cell states affected by individual perturbations and~their genetic interactions. We posit new functions for regulators of differentiation, the anti-viral response, and mitochondrial function during immune activation. By decomposing many high content measurements into the effects of perturbations, their interactions, and diverse cell metadata, Perturb-seq dramatically increases the scope of pooled genomic assays.},

Here, we have developed a targeted proteomics approach for a set of human non-secreted proteins based on parallel reaction monitoring to measure, at steady-state conditions, absolute protein copy numbers across human tissues and cell lines and compared these levels with the corresponding mRNA levels using transcriptomics. The study shows that the transcript and protein levels do not correlate well unless a gene-specific RNA-to-protein (RTP) conversion factor independent of the tissue type is introduced, thus significantly enhancing the predictability of protein copy numbers from RNA levels. The results show that the RTP ratio varies significantly with a few hundred copies per mRNA molecule for some genes to several hundred thousands of protein copies per mRNA molecule for others. In conclusion, our data suggest that transcriptome analysis can be used as a tool to predict the protein copy numbers per cell, thus forming an attractive link between the field of genomics and proteomics.},

It is speculated that the frequency of brain metastasis is increasing for several reasons, including improved systemic therapy and survival, and detection of metastases in asymptomatic patients. The lack of preclinical models that recapitulate the clinical setting and the exclusion of patients with brain metastases from most clinical trials have slowed progress. Molecular factors contributing to brain metastases are being elucidated, such as genes involved in cell adhesion, extravasation, metabolism, and cellular signaling. Furthermore, the role of the unique brain microenvironment is beginning to be explored. Although the presence and function of the blood-brain barrier in metastatic tumors is still poorly understood, it is likely that some tumor cells are protected from therapeutics by the blood-tumor barrier, creating a sanctuary site. This Review discusses what is known about the biology of brain metastases, what preclinical models are available to study the disease, and which novel therapeutic strategies are being studied in patients.},

However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNA-seq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

Our proposed algorithm is based on the Kantorovich dual formulation of the Wasserstein-2 distance as well as a recent neural network architecture, input convex neural network, that is known to parametrize convex functions. The distinguishing features of our method are: i) it only requires samples from the marginal distributions; ii) unlike the existing approaches, it represents the Barycenter with a generative model and can thus generate infinite samples from the barycenter without querying the marginal distributions; iii) it works similar to Generative Adversarial Model in one marginal case. We demonstratethe efficacy of our algorithm by comparing it with the state-of-art methods in multiple experiments.},

Here we acquire single-cell transcriptome and accessible chromatin data over a dense time course in human organoids covering neuroepithelial formation, patterning, brain regionalization and neurogenesis, and identify temporally dynamic and brain-region-specific regulatory regions. We developed Pando-a flexible framework that incorporates multi-omic data and predictions of transcription-factor-binding sites to infer a global gene regulatory network describing organoid development. We use pooled genetic perturbation with single-cell transcriptome readout to assess transcription factor requirement for cell fate and state regulation in organoids. We find that certain factors regulate the abundance of cell fates, whereas other factors affect neuronal cell states after differentiation. We show that the transcription factor GLI3 is required for cortical fate establishment in humans, recapitulating previous research performed in mammalian model systems. We measure transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in normal or GLI3-perturbed cells and identify two distinct GLI3 regulomes that are central to telencephalic fate decisions: one regulating dorsoventral patterning with HES4/5 as direct GLI3 targets, and one controlling ganglionic eminence diversification later in development. Together, we provide a framework for how human model systems and single-cell technologies can be leveraged to reconstruct human developmental biology.},

As CXCR3 activating chemokines CXCL10 (IP-10), CXCL9 (Mig), and CXCL11 (IP-9/I-TAC) specifically attract activated T-cells, this study addressed the question of whether differences in the expression of these chemokines correlate with the site and cellular composition of the skin infiltrates in different types of inflammatory skin disease. Skin biopsies from lichen planus, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus, allergic patch test reactions, psoriasis, and Jessner's lymphocytic infiltration of the skin were investigated for chemokine expression using RNA in situ hybridization, and for the expression of CXCR3 using immunohistochemistry. The results showed differential expression of CXCL10, CXCL9, and CXCL11, which correlated with differences in the localization and cellular composition of the infiltrates. Whereas CXCL10 and CXCL11 were mainly expressed by basal keratinoctyes, CXCL9 mRNA expression was located predominantly in the dermal infiltrates. Correlation with immunohistochemical data suggested that macrophages and activated keratinocytes were the main producers of these chemokines. CXCR3 was expressed by a majority of both CD4+ and CD8+ infiltrating T-cells, suggesting a functional interaction between locally produced chemokines and CXCR3-expressing T-cells. In conclusion, these findings indicate that these CXCR3 activating chemokines play a significant role in the recruitment and maintenance of T-cell infiltrates in the inflammatory skin diseases studied.

To elucidate underlying mechanisms, we developed Perturb-CITE-sequencing (Perturb-CITE-seq), enabling pooled clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)–Cas9 perturbations with single-cell transcriptome and protein readouts. In patient-derived melanoma cells and autologous tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) co-cultures, we profiled transcriptomes and 20\,proteins in \textasciitilde 218,000\,cells under \textasciitilde 750\,perturbations associated with cancer cell-intrinsic ICI resistance (ICR). We recover known mechanisms of resistance, including defects in the interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–JAK/STAT and antigen-presentation pathways in RNA, protein and perturbation space, and new ones, including loss/downregulation of CD58. Loss of CD58 conferred immune evasion in multiple co-culture models and was downregulated in tumors of melanoma patients with ICR. CD58 protein expression was not induced by IFN-γ signaling, and CD58 loss conferred immune evasion without compromising major histocompatibility complex (MHC) expression, suggesting that it acts orthogonally to known mechanisms of ICR. This work provides a framework for the deciphering of complex mechanisms by large-scale perturbation screens with multimodal, single-cell readouts, and discovers potentially clinically relevant mechanisms of immune evasion.},

  abstract = {[We develop a new approach to solving minimum-cost circulation problems. Our approach combines methods for solving the maximum flow problem with successive approximation techniques based on cost scaling. We measure the accuracy of a solution by the amount that the complementary slackness conditions are violated. We propose a simple minimum-cost circulation algorithm, one version of which runs in ¡tex-math¿\$O(n\textasciicircum\{3\}\{\textbackslash rm log\}(nC))\$¡/tex-math¿ time on an n-vertex network with integer arc costs of absolute value at most C. By incorporating sophisticated data structures into the algorithm, we obtain a time bound of ¡tex-math¿\$O(nm\textbackslash{} \{\textbackslash rm log\}(n\textasciicircum\{2\}/m)\{\textbackslash rm log\}(nC))\$¡/tex-math¿ on a network with m arcs. A slightly different use of our approach shows that a minimum-cost circulation can be computed by solving a sequence of O(n log(nC)) blocking flow problems. A corollary of this result is an ¡tex-math¿\$O(n\textasciicircum\{2\}(\{\textbackslash rm log\}n)\{\textbackslash rm log\}(nC))\textbackslash text\{-time\}\$¡/tex-math¿, m-processor parallel minimum-cost circulation algorithm. Our approach also yields strongly polynomial minimum-cost circulation algorithms. Our results provide evidence that the minimum-cost circulation problem is not much harder than the maximum flow problem. We believe that a suitable implementation of our method will perform extremely well in practice.]}

The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available.  Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS.  We apply our two-sample tests  to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly.  Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},

Thirty-two articles were selected from a collection of published literature studying 6299 patients. The parameters for correlation to different variables were calculated by odds ratio, for random and single effects. 38.5\% of patients present BRAF gene mutations, 16.4\% in NRAS, and 10\% in KIT. Mutations of the BRAF gene were correlated to superficial spreading melanoma (odds ratio = 1.31), localization in the torso (odds ratio = 1.42) and presence of metastases. Mutations in NRAS were correlated to nodular melanoma (odds ratio = 1.57), localized in the limbs (odds ratio = 1.31). Mutations of the KIT gene were correlated to mucosal melanoma (odds ratio = 1.59). Populations in Brazil, the US, Sweden, Italian, and Australia were found to be correlated to mutations of BRAF and melanoma.

The response must be potent but carefully controlled to avoid self-damage. How these constraints have shaped the evolution of innate immunity remains poorly understood. Here we characterize the innate immune response’s transcriptional divergence between species and variability in expression among cells. Using bulk and single-cell transcriptomics in fibroblasts and mononuclear phagocytes from different species, challenged with immune stimuli, we map the architecture of the innate immune response. Transcriptionally diverging genes, including those that encode cytokines and chemokines, vary across cells and have distinct promoter structures. Conversely, genes that are involved in the regulation of this response, such as those that encode transcription factors and kinases, are conserved between species and display low cell-to-cell variability in expression. We suggest that this expression pattern, which is observed across species and conditions, has evolved as a mechanism for fine-tuned regulation to achieve an effective but balanced response.},

However, the convergence of GAN training has still not been proved. We propose a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) for training GANs with stochastic gradient descent on arbitrary GAN loss functions. TTUR has an individual learning rate for both the discriminator and the generator. Using the theory of stochastic approximation, we prove that the TTUR converges under mild assumptions to a stationary local Nash equilibrium. The convergence carries over to the popular Adam optimization, for which we prove that it follows the dynamics of a heavy ball with friction and thus prefers flat minima in the objective landscape. For the evaluation of the performance of GANs at image generation, we introduce the “Fr\textbackslash 'echet Inception Distance” (FID) which captures the similarity of generated images to real ones better than the Inception Score. In experiments, TTUR improves learning for DCGANs and Improved Wasserstein GANs (WGAN-GP) outperforming conventional GAN training on CelebA, CIFAR-10, SVHN, LSUN Bedrooms, and the One Billion Word Benchmark.}

Such executable GRNs allow simulation of fundamental hypotheses governing developmental programs and help accelerate the design of strategies to control stem cell fate. We first describe the architecture of IQCELL. Next, we apply IQCELL to scRNA-seq datasets from early mouse T-cell and red blood cell development, and show that the platform can infer overall over 74\% of causal gene interactions previously reported from decades of research. We will also show that dynamic simulations of the generated GRN qualitatively recapitulate the effects of known gene perturbations. Finally, we implement an IQCELL gene selection pipeline that allows us to identify candidate genes, without prior knowledge. We demonstrate that GRN simulations based on the inferred set yield results similar to the original curated lists.

  abstract = {Until recently, high-throughput gene expression technology, such as RNA-Sequencing (RNA-seq) required hundreds of thousands of cells to produce reliable measurements. Recent technical advances permit genome-wide gene expression measurement at the single-cell level. Single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) is the most widely used and numerous publications are based on data produced with this technology. However, RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data are markedly different. In particular, unlike RNA-seq, the majority of reported expression levels in scRNA-seq are zeros, which could be either biologically-driven, genes not expressing RNA at the time of measurement, or technically-driven, genes expressing RNA, but not at a sufficient level to be detected by sequencing technology. Another difference is that the proportion of genes reporting the expression level to be zero varies substantially across single cells compared to RNA-seq samples. However, it remains unclear to what extent this cell-to-cell variation is being driven by technical rather than biological variation. Furthermore, while systematic errors, including batch effects, have been widely reported as a major challenge in high-throughput technologies, these issues have received minimal attention in published studies based on scRNA-seq technology. Here, we use an assessment experiment to examine data from published studies and demonstrate that systematic errors can explain a substantial percentage of observed cell-to-cell expression variability. Specifically, we present evidence that some of these reported zeros are driven by technical variation by demonstrating that scRNA-seq produces more zeros than expected and that this bias is greater for lower expressed genes. In addition, this missing data problem is exacerbated by the fact that this technical variation varies cell-to-cell. Then, we show how this technical cell-to-cell variability can be confused with novel biological results. Finally, we demonstrate and discuss how batch-effects and confounded experiments can intensify the problem.},

  abstract = {Integration of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from multiple experiments, laboratories and technologies can uncover biological insights, but current methods for scRNA-seq data integration are limited by a requirement for datasets to derive from functionally similar cells. We present Scanorama, an algorithm that identifies and merges the shared cell types among all pairs of datasets and accurately integrates heterogeneous collections of scRNA-seq data. We applied Scanorama to integrate and remove batch effects across 105,476 cells from 26 diverse scRNA-seq experiments representing 9 different technologies. Scanorama is sensitive to subtle temporal changes within the same cell lineage, successfully integrating functionally similar cells across time series data of CD14+ monocytes at different stages of differentiation into macrophages. Finally, we show that Scanorama is orders of magnitude faster than existing techniques and can integrate a collection of 1,095,538 cells in just \textasciitilde 9\,h.}

  abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) measures gene expression at the resolution of individual cells. Massively multiplexed single-cell profiling has enabled large-scale transcriptional analyses of thousands of cells in complex tissues. In most cases, the true identity of individual cells is unknown and needs to be inferred from the transcriptomic data. Existing methods typically cluster (group) cells based on similarities of their gene expression profiles and assign the same identity to all cells within each cluster using the averaged expression levels. However, scRNA-seq experiments typically produce low-coverage sequencing data for each cell, which hinders the clustering process.We introduce scMatch, which directly annotates single cells by identifying their closest match in large reference datasets. We used this strategy to annotate various single-cell datasets and evaluated the impacts of sequencing depth, similarity metric and reference datasets. We found that scMatch can rapidly and robustly annotate single cells with comparable accuracy to another recent cell annotation tool (SingleR), but that it is quicker and can handle larger reference datasets. We demonstrate how scMatch can handle large customized reference gene expression profiles that combine data from multiple sources, thus empowering researchers to identify cell populations in any complex tissue with the desired precision.scMatch (Python code) and the FANTOM5 reference dataset are freely available to the research community here https://github.com/forrest-lab/scMatch.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.}

  abstract = {Flow-based models are powerful tools for designing probabilistic models with tractable density. This paper introduces Convex Potential Flows (CP-Flow), a natural and efficient parameterization of invertible models inspired by the optimal transport (OT) theory. CP-Flows are the gradient map of a strongly convex neural potential function. The convexity implies invertibility and allows us to resort to convex optimization to solve the convex conjugate for efficient inversion. To enable maximum likelihood training, we derive a new gradient estimator of the log-determinant of the Jacobian, which involves solving an inverse-Hessian vector product using the conjugate gradient method. The gradient estimator has constant-memory cost, and can be made effectively unbiased by reducing the error tolerance level of the convex optimization routine. Theoretically, we prove that CP-Flows are universal density approximators and are optimal in the OT sense. Our empirical results show that CP-Flow performs competitively on standard benchmarks of density estimation and variational inference.},

  abstract = {High‐throughput single-cell molecular profiling is revolutionizing biology and medicine by unveiling the diversity of cell types and states contributing to development and disease. The identification and characterization of cellular heterogeneity are typically achieved through unsupervised clustering, which crucially relies on a similarity metric.We here propose the use of Optimal Transport (OT) as a cell–cell similarity metric for single-cell omics data. OT defines distances to compare high-dimensional data represented as probability distributions. To speed up computations and cope with the high dimensionality of single-cell data, we consider the entropic regularization of the classical OT distance. We then extensively benchmark OT against state-of-the-art metrics over 13 independent datasets, including simulated, scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data. First, we test the ability of the metrics to detect the similarity between cells belonging to the same groups (e.g. cell types, cell lines of origin). Then, we apply unsupervised clustering and test the quality of the resulting clusters. OT is found to improve cell–cell similarity inference and cell clustering in all simulated and real scRNA-seq data, as well as in scATAC-seq and single-cell DNA methylation data.All our analyses are reproducible through the OT-scOmics Jupyter notebook available at https://github.com/ComputationalSystemsBiology/OT-scOmics.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {Cancer is driven by genetic change, and the advent of massively parallel sequencing has enabled systematic documentation of this variation at the whole-genome scale1–3. Here we report the integrative analysis of 2,658~whole-cancer genomes and their matching normal tissues across 38 tumour types from the Pan-Cancer Analysis of Whole Genomes (PCAWG) Consortium of the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We describe the generation of the PCAWG resource, facilitated by international data sharing using compute clouds. On average, cancer genomes contained 4–5~driver mutations when combining coding and non-coding genomic elements; however, in around 5\% of cases no drivers were identified, suggesting that cancer driver discovery is not yet complete. Chromothripsis, in which many clustered structural variants arise in a single catastrophic event, is frequently an early event in tumour evolution; in acral melanoma, for example, these events precede most somatic point mutations and affect several cancer-associated genes simultaneously. Cancers with abnormal telomere maintenance often originate from tissues with low replicative activity and show several mechanisms of preventing telomere attrition to critical levels. Common and rare germline variants affect patterns of somatic mutation, including point mutations, structural variants and somatic retrotransposition. A collection of papers from the PCAWG Consortium describes non-coding mutations that drive cancer beyond those in the TERT promoter4; identifies new signatures of mutational processes that cause base substitutions, small insertions and deletions and structural variation5,6; analyses timings and patterns of tumour evolution7; describes the diverse transcriptional consequences of somatic mutation on splicing, expression levels, fusion genes and promoter activity8,9; and evaluates a range of more-specialized features of cancer genomes8,10–18.},

  abstract = {Multimodal profiling strategies promise to produce more informative insights into biomedical cohorts via the integration of the information each modality contributes. To perform this integration, however, the development of novel analytical strategies is needed. Multimodal profiling strategies often come at the expense of lower sample numbers, which can challenge methods to uncover shared signals across a cohort. Thus, factor analysis approaches are commonly used for the analysis of high-dimensional data in molecular biology, however, they typically do not yield representations that are directly interpretable, whereas many research questions often center around the analysis of pathways associated with specific observations.We develop PathFA, a novel approach for multimodal factor analysis over the space of pathways. PathFA produces integrative and interpretable views across multimodal profiling technologies, which allow for the derivation of concrete hypotheses. PathFA combines a pathway-learning approach with integrative multimodal capability under a Bayesian procedure that is efficient, hyper-parameter free, and able to automatically infer observation noise from the data. We demonstrate strong performance on small sample sizes within our simulation framework and on matched proteomics and transcriptomics profiles from real tumor samples taken from the Swiss Tumor Profiler consortium. On a subcohort of melanoma patients, PathFA recovers pathway activity that has been independently associated with poor outcome. We further demonstrate the ability of this approach to identify pathways associated with the presence of specific cell-types as well as tumor heterogeneity. Our results show that we capture known biology, making it well suited for analyzing multimodal sample cohorts.The tool is implemented in python and available at https://github.com/ratschlab/path-fa},

  abstract = {Nearly all patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma will progress on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy within the first year of therapy. In the vast majority of progressing melanomas, resistance occurs via the re-activation of MAPK signalling, commonly via alterations in BRAF, NRAS and MEK1/2. A small proportion of resistant melanomas rely on the activation of the compensatory PI3K/AKT signalling cascade, although activation of this pathway does not preclude patient responses to BRAF/MEK inhibition. We now show, that PI3K/AKT signalling via potent oncogenic PIK3CA and AKT3 mutants, is not sufficient to overcome proliferative arrest induced by BRAF/MEK inhibition, but rather enables the survival of a dormant population of MAPK-inhibited melanoma cells. The evolution of resistance in these surviving tumour cells was associated with MAPK re-activation and no longer depended on the initial PI3K/AKT-activating oncogene.

We apply this machine-learning-based approach, CellOracle, to well-established paradigms—mouse and human haematopoiesis, and zebrafish embryogenesis—and we correctly model reported changes in phenotype that occur as a result of transcription factor perturbation. Through systematic in silico transcription factor perturbation in the developing zebrafish, we simulate and experimentally validate a previously unreported~phenotype that results from the loss of noto, an established notochord regulator. Furthermore, we identify an axial mesoderm regulator, lhx1a. Together, these results show that CellOracle can be used to analyse the regulation of cell identity by transcription factors, and can provide mechanistic insights into development and differentiation.},

A third database in KEGG is LIGAND for the information about chemical compounds, enzyme molecules and enzymatic reactions. KEGG provides Java graphics tools for browsing genome maps, comparing two genome maps and manipulating expression maps, as well as computational tools for sequence comparison, graph comparison and path computation.

However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of {$>$}99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.},

BRAF-targeted therapies are effective in patients with melanoma and NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation. In both melanoma and NSCLC, dual inhibition of both BRAF and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) improves response rates compared with BRAF inhibition alone. BRAF-MEK combination therapy (dabrafenib plus trametinib) demonstrated tolerability and efficacy in a recent phase II clinical trial and was approved by the European Medicines Agency and United States Food and Drug Administration for patients with stage IV NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation.

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efficient by fitting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator. Theoretical advantages are reflected in experimental results.}

To study the information processing capacity of human cells, we conducted multiplexed quantification of signaling responses and markers of the cellular state. Signaling nodes in a network displayed adaptive information processing, which led to heterogeneous growth factor responses and enabled nodes to capture partially nonredundant information about the cellular state. Collectively, as a multimodal percept this gives individual cells a large information processing capacity to accurately place growth factor concentration within the context of their cellular state and make cellular state–dependent decisions. Heterogeneity and complexity in signaling networks may have coevolved to enable specific and context-aware cellular decision-making in a multicellular setting.},

  abstract = {The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway plays a vital role in cellular processes such as gene expression, cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis. Also known as the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK pathway, the MAPK pathway has been implicated in approximately one-third of all cancers. Mutations in RAS or RAF genes such as KRAS and BRAF are common, and these mutations typically promote malignancies by over-activating MEK and ERK downstream, which drives sustained cell proliferation and uninhibited cell growth. Development of drugs targeting this pathway has been a research area of great interest, especially drugs targeting the inhibition of MEK. In vitro and clinical studies have shown promise for certain MEK inhibitors (MEKi) , and MEKi have become the first treatment option for certain cancers. Despite promising results, not all patients have a response to MEKi, and mechanisms of resistance typically arise in patients who do have a positive initial response. This paper summarizes recent developments regarding MEKi, the mechanisms of adaptive resistance to MEKi, and the potential solutions to the issue of adaptive MEKi resistance.},

  abstract = {Biology has become a data-intensive science. Recent technological advances in single-cell genomics have enabled the measurement of multiple facets of cellular state, producing datasets with millions of single-cell observations. While these data hold great promise for understanding molecular mechanisms in health and disease, analysis challenges arising from sparsity, technical and biological variability, and high dimensionality of the data hinder the derivation of such mechanistic insights. To promote the innovation of algorithms for analysis of multimodal single-cell data, we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021 applying the Common Task Framework to multimodal single-cell data integration. For this competition we generated the first multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell biology and defined three tasks in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning modalities, and learning a joint representation across modalities. We further specified evaluation metrics and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this setup, 280 competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period, showcasing substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task. Here, we present the results, describe trends of well performing approaches, and discuss challenges associated with running the competition.},

This problem arises in the analysis of single cell RNA-sequencing data, which provide high dimensional measurements of cell states but cannot track the trajectories of the cells over time. We prove that for a class of stochastic processes it is possible to recover the ground truth trajectories from limited samples of the temporal marginals at each time-point, and provide an efficient algorithm to do so in practice. The method we develop, Global Waddington-OT (gWOT), boils down to a smooth convex optimization problem posed globally over all time-points involving entropy-regularized optimal transport. We demonstrate that this problem can be solved efficiently in practice and yields good reconstructions, as we show on several synthetic and real datasets.},

  abstract = {Summary Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) manifests as phenotypically and functionally diverse cells, often within the same patient. Intratumor phenotypic and functional heterogeneity have been linked primarily by physical sorting experiments, which assume that functionally distinct subpopulations can be prospectively isolated by surface phenotypes. This assumption has proven problematic, and we therefore developed a data-driven approach. Using mass cytometry, we profiled surface and intracellular signaling proteins simultaneously in millions of healthy and leukemic cells. We developed PhenoGraph, which algorithmically defines phenotypes in high-dimensional single-cell data. PhenoGraph revealed that the surface phenotypes of leukemic blasts do not necessarily reflect their intracellular state. Using hematopoietic progenitors, we defined a signaling-based measure of cellular phenotype, which led to isolation of a gene expression signature that was predictive of survival in independent cohorts. This study presents new methods for large-scale analysis of single-cell heterogeneity and demonstrates their utility, yielding insights into AML pathophysiology.}

Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are powerful generative models which have been successfully applied to learn maps across high-dimensional domains. However, little is known about the nature of the map learned with a GAN objective. To address this problem, we propose a generative adversarial model in which the discriminator's objective is the \$2\$-Wasserstein metric. We show that during training, our generator follows the \$W\_2\$-geodesic between the initial and the target distributions. As a consequence, it reproduces an optimal map at the end of training. We validate our approach empirically in both low-dimensional and high-dimensional continuous settings, and show that it outperforms prior methods on image data.},

Here, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to survey the transcriptomes of 57,669 cells derived from three CC tumors with paired normal adjacent non-tumor (NAT) samples. Single-cell transcriptomics analysis revealed extensive heterogeneity in malignant cells of human CCs, wherein epithelial subpopulation exhibited different genomic and transcriptomic signatures. We also identified cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) that may promote tumor progression of CC, and further distinguished inflammatory CAF (iCAF) and myofibroblastic CAF (myCAF). CD8+ T cell diversity revealed both proliferative (MKI67+) and non-cycling exhausted (PDCD1+) subpopulations at the end of the trajectory path. We used the epithelial signature genes derived from scRNA-seq to deconvolute bulk RNA-seq data of CC, identifying four different CC subtypes, namely hypoxia (S-H subtype), proliferation (S-P subtype), differentiation (S-D subtype), and immunoactive (S-I subtype) subtype. The S-H subtype showed the worst prognosis, while CC patients of the S-I subtype had the longest overall survival time. Our results lay the foundation for precision prognostic and therapeutic stratification of CC.},

To identify regulatory interactions controlling the endocytic membrane system, we conducted 13 RNAi screens on multiple endocytic activities and their downstream organelles. Combined with image analysis of thousands of single cells per perturbation and their cell-to-cell variability, this created a high-quality and cross-comparable quantitative data set. Unbiased analysis revealed emergent properties of the endocytic membrane system and how its complexity evolved and distinct programs of regulatory control that coregulate specific subsets of endocytic uptake routes and organelle abundances. We show that these subset effects allow the mapping of functional regulatory interactions and their interaction motifs between kinases, membrane-trafficking machinery, and the cytoskeleton at a large scale, some of which we further characterize. Our work presents a powerful approach to identify regulatory interactions in complex cellular systems from parallel single-gene or double-gene perturbation screens in human cells and yeast.},

To address this challenge, here we use a combination of automated approaches and expert curation to develop a collection of “hallmark” gene sets as part of MSigDB. Each hallmark in this collection consists of a “refined” gene set, derived from multiple “founder” sets, that conveys a specific biological state or process and displays coherent expression. The hallmarks effectively summarize most of the relevant information of the original founder sets and, by reducing both variation and redundancy, provide more refined and concise inputs for gene set enrichment analysis.,},

The primary endpoint to provide drug response profiling reports within 7\,d was met in 91\% of all study participants (N\,=\,80). Secondary endpoint analysis revealed that ex vivo resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs predicted chemotherapy treatment failure in vivo. We confirmed the predictive value of ex vivo response to chemotherapy in a validation cohort of 95 individuals with acute myeloid leukemia treated with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Ex vivo drug response profiles improved ELN-22 risk stratification in individuals with adverse risk.

Successful and flexible integration of scRNA-Seq datasets from multiple sources promises to be an effective avenue to obtain further biological insights. This study presents a comprehensive approach to integration for scRNA-seq data analysis. It addresses the challenges involved in successful integration of scRNA-seq datasets by using the knowledge of genes that appear not to change across all samples and a robust algorithm to infer pseudoreplicates between datasets. This information is then consolidated into a single-factor model that enables tailored incorporation of prior knowledge. The effectiveness of scMerge is demonstrated by extensive comparison with other approaches.Concerted examination of multiple collections of single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data promises further biological insights that cannot be uncovered with individual datasets. Here we present scMerge, an algorithm that integrates multiple single-cell RNA-seq datasets using factor analysis of stably expressed genes and pseudoreplicates across datasets. Using a large collection of public datasets, we benchmark scMerge against published methods and demonstrate that it consistently provides improved cell type separation by removing unwanted factors; scMerge can also enhance biological discovery through robust data integration, which we show through the inference of development trajectory in a liver dataset collection.}

  abstract = {The key idea behind the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation which can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common assumptions. We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than \$12000\$ models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties “encouraged” by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks. Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering several data sets.},

  abstract = {Learning disentangled representations is considered a cornerstone problem in representation learning. Recently, Locatello et al. (2019) demonstrated that unsupervised disentanglement learning without inductive biases is theoretically impossible and that existing inductive biases and unsupervised methods do not allow to consistently learn disentangled representations. However, in many practical settings, one might have access to a limited amount of supervision, for example through manual labeling of (some) factors of variation in a few training examples. In this paper, we investigate the impact of such supervision on state-of-the-art disentanglement methods and perform a large scale study, training over 52000 models under well-defined and reproducible experimental conditions. We observe that a small number of labeled examples (0.01–0.5\% of the data set), with potentially imprecise and incomplete labels, is sufficient to perform model selection on state-of-the-art unsupervised models. Further, we investigate the benefit of incorporating supervision into the training process. Overall, we empirically validate that with little and imprecise supervision it is possible to reliably learn disentangled representations.}

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

However, an exhaustive exploration of the combinatorial perturbation space is experimentally unfeasible. Therefore, computational methods are needed to predict, interpret, and prioritize perturbations. Here, we present the compositional perturbation autoencoder (CPA), which combines the interpretability of linear models with the flexibility of deep-learning approaches for single-cell response modeling. CPA learns to in silico predict transcriptional perturbation response at the single-cell level for unseen dosages, cell types, time points, and species. Using newly generated single-cell drug combination data, we validate that CPA can predict unseen drug combinations while outperforming baseline models. Additionally, the architecture's modularity enables incorporating the chemical representation of the drugs, allowing the prediction of cellular response to completely unseen drugs. Furthermore, CPA is also applicable to genetic combinatorial screens. We demonstrate this by imputing in silico 5,329 missing combinations (97.6\% of all possibilities) in a single-cell Perturb-seq experiment with diverse genetic interactions. We envision CPA will facilitate efficient experimental design and hypothesis generation by enabling in silico response prediction at the single-cell level and thus accelerate therapeutic applications using single-cell technologies.},

We conduct a neutral, multi-faceted large-scale empirical study on state-of-the art models and evaluation measures. We find that most models can reach similar scores with enough hyperparameter optimization and random restarts. This suggests that improvements can arise from a higher computational budget and tuning more than fundamental algorithmic changes. To overcome some limitations of the current metrics, we also propose several data sets on which precision and recall can be computed. Our experimental results suggest that future GAN research should be based on more systematic and objective evaluation procedures. Finally, we did not find evidence that any of the tested algorithms consistently outperforms the non-saturating GAN introduced in \{goodfellow2014generative\}.}

Matching the aggregated posterior to the prior ensures that generating from any part of prior space results in meaningful samples. As a result, the decoder of the adversarial autoencoder learns a deep generative model that maps the imposed prior to the data distribution. We show how the adversarial autoencoder can be used in applications such as semi-supervised classification, disentangling style and content of images, unsupervised clustering, dimensionality reduction and data visualization. We performed experiments on MNIST, Street View House Numbers and Toronto Face datasets and show that adversarial autoencoders achieve competitive results in generative modeling and semi-supervised classification tasks.}

  abstract = {In this paper, we present a novel and principled approach to learn the optimal transport between two distributions, from samples. Guided by the optimal transport theory, we learn the optimal Kantorovich potential which induces the optimal transport map. This involves learning two convex functions, by solving a novel minimax optimization. Building upon recent advances in the field of input convex neural networks, we propose a new framework to estimate the optimal transport mapping as the gradient of a convex function that is trained via minimax optimization. Numerical experiments confirm the accuracy of the learned transport map. Our approach can be readily used to train a deep generative model. When trained between a simple distribution in the latent space and a target distribution, the learned optimal transport map acts as a deep generative model. Although scaling this to a large dataset is challenging, we demonstrate two important strengths over standard adversarial training: robustness and discontinuity. As we seek the optimal transport, the learned generative model provides the same mapping regardless of how we initialize the neural networks. Further, a gradient of a neural network can easily represent discontinuous mappings, unlike standard neural networks that are constrained to be continuous. This allows the learned transport map to match any target distribution with many discontinuous supports and achieve sharp boundaries.},

  abstract = {A fundamental goal in cancer research is to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation. This is key to developing more efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches. One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the 1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily. Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the Integrative OncoGenomics(IntOGen) pipeline, an implementation of such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer drivers. Its application to somatic mutations of more than 28,000 tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour mutations will support the continuous refinement of our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer.},

As new insights are gained into the underlying pathology of SLE, there have been an unprecedented number of new agents under development to treat the disease via a diverse range of targets. One such class of emerging agents target interferon (IFN) signalling. In this article, we review the preclinical evidence that the inhibition of the secretion and downstream effectors of both IFN-α and IFN-γ may be effective for the treatment of SLE. The primary agents that are currently in clinical development to treat SLE via the targeting of interferon pathways are monoclonal neutralising antibodies (Mab) that bind to and neutralise IFN-γ (AMG 811), IFN-α (sifalimumab, rontalizumab and AGS-009) or its receptor (anifrolumab), and IFN-α kinoid, which is a drug composed of inactivated IFN-α molecules coupled to the keyhole limpet haemocyanin protein. Phase I and II trials have demonstrated acceptable short-term safety with no increase in severe viral infections or reactivation, favourable pharmacokinetic profiles and an inhibition of IFN-associated gene overexpression; however, the impact of these drugs on disease activity must still be assessed in phase III clinical trials. This review concludes with a summary of the challenges that are inherent to this approach to managing SLE.},

  abstract = {Bulk and single-cell DNA sequencing has enabled reconstructing clonal substructures of somatic tissues from frequency and cooccurrence patterns of somatic variants. However, approaches to characterize phenotypic variations between clones are not established. Here we present cardelino (https://github.com/single-cell-genetics/cardelino), a computational method for inferring the clonal tree configuration and the clone of origin of individual cells assayed using single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). Cardelino flexibly integrates information from imperfect clonal trees inferred based on bulk exome-seq data, and sparse variant alleles expressed in scRNA-seq data. We apply cardelino to a published cancer dataset and to newly generated matched scRNA-seq and exome-seq data from 32 human dermal fibroblast lines, identifying hundreds of differentially expressed genes between cells from different somatic clones. These genes are frequently enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways, indicating a role for cell division genes in somatic evolution in healthy skin.}

  abstract = {The epicardium, the mesothelial envelope of the vertebrate heart, is the source of multiple cardiac cell lineages during embryonic development and provides signals that are essential to myocardial growth and repair. Here we generate self-organizing human pluripotent stem cell-derived epicardioids that display retinoic acid-dependent morphological, molecular and functional patterning of the epicardium and myocardium typical of the left ventricular wall. By combining lineage tracing, single-cell transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility profiling, we describe the specification and differentiation process of different cell lineages in epicardioids and draw comparisons to human fetal development at the transcriptional and morphological levels. We then use epicardioids to investigate the functional cross-talk between cardiac cell types, gaining new insights into the role of IGF2/IGF1R and NRP2 signaling in human cardiogenesis. Finally, we show that epicardioids mimic the multicellular pathogenesis of congenital or stress-induced hypertrophy and fibrotic remodeling. As such, epicardioids offer a unique testing ground of epicardial activity in heart development, disease and regeneration.},

  abstract = {The number of cancer survivors continues to increase in the United States due to the growth and aging of the population as well as advances in early detection and treatment. To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate triennially to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries, vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Database are presented for the most prevalent cancer types by race, and cancer-related and treatment-related side-effects are also briefly described. More than 18 million Americans (8.3 million males and 9.7 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2022. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,523,230), melanoma of the skin (760,640), and colon and rectum (726,450) among males and breast (4,055,770), uterine corpus (891,560), and thyroid (823,800) among females. More than one-half (53\%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and two-thirds (67\%) were aged 65 years or older. One of the largest racial disparities in treatment is for rectal cancer, for which 41\% of Black patients with stage I disease receive proctectomy or proctocolectomy compared to 66\% of White patients. Surgical receipt is also substantially lower among Black patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 49\% for stages I-II and 16\% for stage III versus 55\% and 22\% for White patients, respectively. These treatment disparities are exacerbated by the fact that Black patients continue to be less likely to be diagnosed with stage I disease than White patients for most cancers, with some of the largest disparities for female breast (53\% vs 68\%) and endometrial (59\% vs 73\%). Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based strategies and equitable access to available resources are needed to mitigate disparities for communities of color and optimize care for people with a history of cancer.

  abstract = {Wasserstein gradient flows provide a powerful means of understanding and solving many diffusion equations. Specifically, Fokker-Planck equations, which model the diffusion of probability measures, can be understood as gradient descent over entropy functionals in Wasserstein space. This equivalence, introduced by Jordan, Kinderlehrer and Otto, inspired the so-called JKO scheme to approximate these diffusion processes via an implicit discretization of the gradient flow in Wasserstein space. Solving the optimization problem associated with each JKO step, however, presents serious computational challenges. We introduce a scalable method to approximate Wasserstein gradient flows, targeted to machine learning applications. Our approach relies on input-convex neural networks (ICNNs) to discretize the JKO steps, which can be optimized by stochastic gradient descent. Contrarily to previous work, our method does not require domain discretization or particle simulation.  As a result, we can sample from the measure at each time step of the diffusion and compute its probability density. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by computing diffusions following the Fokker-Planck equation and apply it to unnormalized density sampling as well as nonlinear filtering.},

For a global view of IFN signatures and regulatory pathways, we performed gene expression and chromatin analyses of the IFN-induced response across a range of immunocyte lineages. These distinguished ISGs by cell-type specificity, kinetics, and sensitivity to tonic IFN, and revealed underlying changes in chromatin configuration. We combined 1398 human and mouse datasets to computationally infer ISG modules and their regulators, validated by genetic analysis in both species. Some ISGs are controlled by Stat1/2 and Irf9 and the ISRE DNA motif, but others appeared dependent on non-canonical factors. This regulatory framework helped to interpret JAK1 blockade pharmacology, different clusters being affected under tonic or IFN-stimulated conditions, and the IFN signatures previously associated with human diseases, revealing unrecognized subtleties in disease footprints, as affected by human ancestry.},

Insight into the possible mechanisms leading to genomic instability can be gained by reviewing the recent high-throughput sequencing studies of human cancers.In hereditary cancers, characterized either by microsatellite instability or chromosomal instability, the underlying basis for the genomic instability is mutations in DNA repair genes.In sporadic (non-hereditary) cancers, genomic instability, at least at the early stages of cancer development, is not due to mutations in DNA repair genes or mitotic checkpoint genes.The pattern of mutations in sporadic human cancers suggests that the selective pressure for tumour suppressor p53 (TP53) mutations is linked to DNA damage, rather than p14ARF activation.Genomic instability in sporadic human cancers may be linked to oncogene-induced DNA damage.Analysis of the recent high-throughput sequencing studies of human cancers suggests that genomic instability can be added to the original hallmarks of cancer, and that two previously distinct hallmarks, self-sufficiency in growth signals and insensitivity to anti-growth signals, can be consolidated into one.},

We therefore performed a comprehensive assessment of human bone marrow cells using both single-cell RNA sequencing and multiparameter flow cytometry from 20 healthy adult human donors across a broad age range. These data characterize variation between healthy donors as well as age-associated changes in cell population frequencies. Direct comparison of techniques revealed discrepancy in the quantification of T lymphocyte and natural killer cell populations. Orthogonal validation of immunophenotyping using mass cytometry demonstrated a strong correlation with flow cytometry. Technical replicates using single-cell RNA sequencing matched robustly, while biological replicates showed variation. Given the increasing use of single-cell technologies in translational research, this resource serves as an important reference data set and highlights opportunities for further refinement.}

  abstract = {Paclitaxel is one of the most important lead compounds to emerge from a natural source. Because of the complex and unusual chemistry of paclitaxel, it is mainly extracted from the bark of a slow growing Western yew. Although total chemical synthesis of paclitaxel has been achieved, it may not be feasible commercially. Paclitaxel has a low therapeutic index: it is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water. The commercially available injection preparation is a sterile solution of the drug in Cremophor® EL and dehydrated alcohol. Present-day cancer chemotherapy with paclitaxel frequently causes hypersensitivity reactions. The major hurdles for successful therapy with paclitaxel are the availability of the drug and its delivery. The importance of developing an improved delivery system for paclitaxel is obvious from the problems seen from present-day therapy. Hence, the current approaches are mainly focused on: (1) developing formulations that are devoid of Cremophor® EL, (2) the possibility of large-scale preparation; and (3) stability for longer periods of time. The path to identify new molecules with better therapeutic efficacy will continue to be an integral part of health care systems, but the author is emphasizing the importance of `better delivery of drugs' which is going to further refine the therapy. The different approaches investigated so far have shown much promise in replacing the Cremophor® based vehicle for paclitaxel delivery. However, the final product for human use is still far away. Therefore this review is the first comprehensive account of the pharmaceutical aspects of paclitaxel, with special emphasis on its delivery.},

  abstract = {The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical regulator of tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Since immune cells represent a large fraction of the TME, they play a key role in mediating pro- and anti-tumor immune responses. Immune escape, which suppresses anti-tumor immunity, enables tumor cells to maintain their proliferation and growth. Numerous mechanisms, which have been intensively studied in recent years, are involved in this process and based on these findings, novel immunotherapies have been successfully developed. Here, we review the composition of the TME and the mechanisms by which immune evasive processes are regulated. In detail, we describe membrane-bound and soluble factors, their regulation, and their impact on immune cell activation in the TME. Furthermore, we give an overview of the tumor/antigen presentation and how it is influenced under malignant conditions. Finally, we summarize novel TME-targeting agents, which are already in clinical trials for different tumor entities.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic cross-resistance to inhibition of different signaling pathways may hamper development of combinatorial treatments in melanoma, but the relative frequency of this phenotype and the strategies to overcome this hurdle remain poorly understood. Among 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not previously treated with target therapy, 21 (42.9\%) showed strong primary resistance (IC50 {$>$} 1 μM) to a BRAFV600E inhibitor. Most of the BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cell lines showed also strong or intermediate cross-resistance to MEK1/2- and to PI3K/mTOR-specific inhibitors. Primary cross-resistance was confirmed in an independent set of 23 BRAF-mutant short-term melanoma cell cultures. MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR co-targeting was the most effective approach, compared to BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual blockade, to counteract primary resistance to BRAF inhibition and the cross-resistant phenotype. This was shown by extensive drug interaction analysis, tumor growth inhibition assays in-vivo, p-ERK and p-AKT inhibition, promotion of melanoma apoptosis, apoptosis-related protein modulation, activation of effector caspases and selective modulation of genes involved in melanoma drug resistance and belonging to the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT canonical pathways. Compared to co-targeting of mutant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR, the association of a MEK1/2 and a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor was more effective in the activation of Bax and of caspase-3 and in the induction of caspase-dependent melanoma apoptosis. Furthermore Bax silencing reduced the latter effects. These results suggest that intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition is frequently associated with primary cross-resistance to MEK and PI3K/mTOR blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma and provide pre-clinical evidence for a combinatorial approach to counteract this phenotype.},

Although four of them, A3A, A3B, A3F and A3G, are induced by type-1-interferon (IFN-I), their role in inflammatory conditions is unknown. We thus investigated the expression of A3, and particularly A3A and A3B because of their ability to edit cellular DNA, in Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by high IFN-α serum levels. In a cohort of 57 SLE patients, A3A and A3B, but also A3C and A3G, were upregulated \textasciitilde\,10 to 15-fold ({$>$}\,1000-fold for A3B) compared to healthy controls, particularly in patients with flares and elevated serum IFN-α levels. Hydroxychloroquine, corticosteroids and immunosuppressive treatment did not reverse A3 levels. The A3AΔ3B polymorphism, which potentiates A3A, was detected in 14.9\% of patients and in 10\% of controls, and was associated with higher A3A mRNA expression. A3A and A3B mRNA levels, but not A3C or A3G, were correlated positively with dsDNA breaks and negatively with lymphopenia. Exposure of SLE PBMCs to IFN-α in culture induced massive and sustained A3A levels by 4~h and led to massive cell death. Furthermore, the rs2853669 A\,{$>$}\,G polymorphism in the telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) promoter, which disrupts an Ets-TCF-binding site and influences certain cancers, was highly prevalent in SLE patients, possibly contributing to lymphopenia. Taken together, these findings suggest that high baseline A3A and A3B levels may contribute to cell frailty, lymphopenia and to the generation of neoantigens in SLE patients. Targeting A3 expression could be a strategy to reverse cell death and the generation of neoantigens.},

Comparative analysis between groups of scRNA-seq samples brings additional statistical considerations, and currently there is a lack of tools to address this common scenario. Based on our experience with comparative designs, here we present a computational suite (Cacoa – case-control analysis) to carry out statistical tests, exploration, and visualization of scRNA-seq sample cohorts. Using multiple example datasets, we demonstrate how application of these techniques can provide additional insights, and avoid issues stemming from inter-individual variability, limited sample size, and high dimensionality of the data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients affected by high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) progression to muscle invasive status is considered as the main indicator of local treatment failure. We aimed to investigate the effect of progression and time to progression on overall survival (OS) and to investigate their validity as surrogate endpoints. METHODS: A total of 1,510 patients from 18 different institutions treated for T1 high grade NMIBC, followed by a secondary transurethral resection and BCG intravesical instillation. We relied on random survival forest (RSF) to rank covariates based on OS prediction. Cox's regression models were used to quantify the effect of covariates on mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 49.0 months, 485 (32.1\%) patients progressed to MIBC, while 163 (10.8\%) patients died. The median time to progression was 82 (95\%CI: 78.0-93.0) months. In RSF time-to-progression and age were the most predictive covariates of OS. The survival tree defined 5 groups of risk. In multivariable Cox's regression models accounting for progression status as time-dependent covariate, shorter time to progression (as continuous covariate) was associated with longer OS (HR: 9.0, 95\%CI: 3.0-6.7; P {$<$} 0.001). Virtually same results after time to progression stratification (time to progression ≥10.5 months as reference). CONCLUSION: Time to progression is the main predictor of OS in patients with high risk NMIBC treated with BCG and might be considered a coprimary endpoint. In addition, models including time to progression could be considered for patients' stratification in clinical practice and at the time of clinical trials design.},

In human astrocytoma cells, beta-R1 was induced to an equivalent extent by 10 IU/mL IFN-beta or 2500 IU/mL IFN-alpha2. To address the mechanism of this differential response, we analyzed induction of the beta-R1 gene in fibrosarcoma cells and derivative mutant cells lacking components required for signaling by type I IFNs. beta-R1 was readily induced by IFN-beta in the parental 2fTGH cell line, but not by recombinant IFN-alpha2, IFN-alpha Con1, or a mixture of IFN-alpha subtypes. IFN-alpha8 induced beta-R1 weakly. beta-R1 was not induced by IFN-beta in mutant cell lines U2A, U3A, U4A, and U6A, which lack, respectively, p48, STAT1, JAK1, and STAT2. U5A cells, which lack the Ifnar 2.2 component of the IFN-alpha and -beta receptor, also failed to express beta-R1. U1A cells are partially responsive to IFN-beta and IFN-alpha8 but lacked beta-R1 expression, indicating that TYK2 protein is essential for induction of this gene. Taken together, these results suggest that the expression of beta-R1 in response to type I IFN requires IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 plus an additional component, which is more efficiently formed on induction by IFN-beta compared with IFN-alpha.},

  abstract = {The number of protons released from several mammalian hemoglobins as a consequence of oxygenation is greater in the presence of low concentrations of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate than in its absence. A mechanism for this enhancement of proton release is proposed. The basis of this mechanism is that 2,3-diphosphoglycerate binds primarily between the protonated α-NH2 terminal groups of the two β chains in deoxyhemoglobin. This binding will shift the ionization equilibria in favor of the protonation of the deoxyhemoglobin. Partial release of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate upon oxygenation of the hemoglobin is then accompanied by a release of protons. The apparent enthalpy of diphosphoglycerate binding appears to be close to zero. The previously reported temperature dependence appears to be due entirely to the associated protonation reaction.

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.},

However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible multigene perturbations severely limits experimental interrogation. Here, we present graph-enhanced gene activation and repression simulator (GEARS), a method that integrates deep learning with a knowledge graph of gene–gene relationships to predict transcriptional responses to both single and multigene perturbations using single-cell RNA-sequencing data from perturbational screens. GEARS is able to predict outcomes of perturbing combinations consisting of genes that were never experimentally perturbed. GEARS exhibited 40\% higher precision than existing approaches in predicting four distinct genetic interaction subtypes in a combinatorial perturbation screen and identified the strongest interactions twice as well as prior approaches. Overall, GEARS can predict phenotypically distinct effects of multigene perturbations and thus guide the design of perturbational experiments.},

However, the state-of-the-art suffers from the loss of biological information due to feature conversion and struggles with modality-specific populations. To overcome these crucial limitations, we here introduced scConfluence, a novel method for single-cell diagonal integration. scConfluence combines uncoupled autoencoders on the complete set of features with regularized Inverse Optimal Transport on weakly connected features. We extensively benchmark scConfluence in several single-cell integration scenarios proving that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. We then demonstrate the biological relevance of scConfluence in three applications. We predict spatial patterns for Scgn, Synpr and Olah in scRNA-smFISH integration. We improve the classification of B cells and Monocytes in highly heterogeneous scRNA-scATAC-CyTOF integration. Finally, we reveal the joint contribution of Fezf2 and apical dendrite morphology in Intra Telencephalic neurons, based on morphological images and scRNA.},

The latter gives rise to populations related to pluripotent, extra-embryonic, and neural cells, with each harboring multiple finer subpopulations. The analysis predicts transcription factors and paracrine signals that affect fates and experiments validate~that the TF Obox6 and the cytokine GDF9 enhance reprogramming efficiency. Our approach sheds light on the process and outcome of reprogramming and provides a framework applicable to diverse temporal processes in biology.},

The encoded protein is a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, transmitting information from the outside to the cell nucleus. The main function of the MAPK/ERK pathway is to regulate cell growth, migration, and proliferation. The most common mutations in the BRAF gene encode the V600E mutant (class I), which causes continuous activation and signal transduction, regardless of external stimulus. Consequently, cell proliferation and invasion are enhanced in cancer patients with such mutations. The V600E mutation has been linked to melanoma, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, and other types of cancers. Importantly, emerging evidence has recently indicated that new types of mutations (classes II and III) also play a paramount role in the development of cancer. In this minireview, we discuss the influence of various BRAF mutations in cancer, including aberrant transcriptional gene regulation in the affected tissues.},

A drug-repositioning screen identified the HIV1-protease inhibitor nelfinavir as potent suppressor of PAX3 and MITF expression. Nelfinavir profoundly sensitizes BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma cells to MAPK-pathway inhibitors. Moreover, nelfinavir is~effective in BRAF and NRAS mutant melanoma cells isolated from patients progressed on MAPK inhibitor (MAPKi) therapy and in BRAF/NRAS/PTEN mutant tumors.

Here we analyse, for the first time, the heterogeneous patterns of related cellular activities, namely virus infection, endocytosis and membrane lipid composition in adherent human cells. We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell, and we derive probabilistic models that can explain and predict most cellular heterogeneity of these activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population context. We find that accounting for population-determined heterogeneity is essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels of cell populations. Finally, we reveal that synergy between two molecular components, focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid GM1, enhances the population-determined pattern of simian virus 40 (SV40) infection.

Here we study the influence of the cell population context, which determines a single cell's microenvironment, in image-based RNAi screens. We developed a comprehensive computational approach that employs Bayesian and multivariate methods at the single-cell level. We applied these methods to 45 RNA interference screens of various sizes, including 7 druggable genome and 2 genome-wide screens, analysing 17 different mammalian virus infections and four related cell physiological processes. Analysing cell-based screens at this depth reveals widespread RNAi-induced changes in the population context of individual cells leading to indirect RNAi effects, as well as perturbations of cell-to-cell variability regulators. We find that accounting for indirect effects improves the consistency between siRNAs targeted against the same gene, and between replicate RNAi screens performed in different cell lines, in different labs, and with different siRNA libraries. In an era where large-scale RNAi screens are increasingly performed to reach a systems-level understanding of cellular processes, we show that this is often improved by analyses that account for and incorporate the single-cell microenvironment.},

  abstract = {Diffusion Schrödinger bridges (DSBs) have recently emerged as a powerful framework for recovering stochastic dynamics via their marginal observations at different time points. Despite numerous successful applications, existing algorithms for solving DSBs have so far failed to utilize the structure of aligned data, which naturally arises in many biological phenomena. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithmic framework that, for the first time, solves DSBs while respecting the data alignment. Our approach hinges on a combination of two decades-old ideas: The classical Schrödinger bridge theory and Doob’s \$h\$-transform. Compared to prior methods, our approach leads to a simpler training procedure with lower variance, which we further augment with principled regularization schemes. This ultimately leads to sizeable improvements across experiments on synthetic and real data, including the tasks of predicting conformational changes in proteins and temporal evolution of cellular differentiation processes.},

  abstract = {Background BRAF mutations are a common finding in malignant melanoma (MM). Nevertheless, apart from their significance as a therapeutic target in advanced melanoma, their prognostic value is still debated. Objective To assess BRAF mutation status in primary, recurrent, or metastatic MM and its correlations with histopathological findings. Methods We analyzed 203 samples from 178 consecutive patients: 129 primary cutaneous MM, 49 metastatic and recurrent MM of unknown primary site, and 25 cases of recurrences or metastases of primary MM. BRAF mutations in exon 15 were identified with real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or direct sequencing or pyrosequencing. Histopathological examination was performed according to standard procedures. Results We observed a 42.1\% prevalence of BRAF mutations at codon 600 among our patients, 84\% of whom harbored the V600E mutation. Mutations showed a statistically significant increase in younger patients (P = 0.011), in ulcerated tumors (P = 0.020), and in tumors lacking solar elastosis in adjacent dermis (P = 0.008). Mutations were also more common in male patients, as well as in primary MMs of the torso, and in nonvisceral metastases, however without reaching statistical significance. Logistic regression analysis identified type and ulceration as the only significant predictors of BRAF mutation. The highest frequencies of mutated BRAF were identified in superficial spreading and nodular types, and the lowest in acral lentiginous and lentigo maligna types. In situ MM and primary dermal melanoma displayed intermediate frequencies. Conclusion Frequency of mutated BRAF is type-related and correlated with ulceration, a known adverse prognostic factor.},

Here, we introduce “sci-Plex,” which uses “nuclear hashing” to quantify global transcriptional responses to thousands of independent perturbations at single-cell resolution. As a proof of concept, we applied sci-Plex to screen three cancer cell lines exposed to 188 compounds. In total, we profiled \textasciitilde 650,000 single-cell transcriptomes across \textasciitilde 5000 independent samples in one experiment. Our results reveal substantial intercellular heterogeneity in response to specific compounds, commonalities in response to families of compounds, and insight into differential properties within families. In particular, our results with histone deacetylase inhibitors support the view that chromatin acts as an important reservoir of acetate in cancer cells.},

They involve tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription factors by Janus tyrosine kinases at the cell membrane, followed by release of signal transducers and activators of transcription and their migration to the nucleus, where they induce the expression of the many gene products that determine the responses. Ancillary pathways are also activated by the interferons, but their effects on cell physiology are less clear. The Janus kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription, and many of the interferon-induced proteins, play important alternative roles in cells, raising interesting questions as to how the responses to the interferons intersect with more general aspects of cellular physiology and how the specificity of cytokine responses is maintained.},

  abstract = {Recent technological advances have led to an increase in the production and availability of single-cell data. The ability to integrate a set of multi-technology measurements would allow the identification of biologically or clinically meaningful observations through the unification of the perspectives afforded by each technology. In most cases, however, profiling technologies consume the used cells and thus pairwise correspondences between datasets are lost. Due to the sheer size single-cell datasets can acquire, scalable algorithms that are able to universally match single-cell measurements carried out in one cell to its corresponding sibling in another technology are needed.We propose Single-Cell data Integration via Matching (SCIM), a scalable approach to recover such correspondences in two or more technologies. SCIM assumes that cells share a common (low-dimensional) underlying structure and that the underlying cell distribution is approximately constant across technologies. It constructs a technology-invariant latent space using an autoencoder framework with an adversarial objective. Multi-modal datasets are integrated by pairing cells across technologies using a bipartite matching scheme that operates on the low-dimensional latent representations. We evaluate SCIM on a simulated cellular branching process and show that the cell-to-cell matches derived by SCIM reflect the same pseudotime on the simulated dataset. Moreover, we apply our method to two real-world scenarios, a melanoma tumor sample and a human bone marrow sample, where we pair cells from a scRNA dataset to their sibling cells in a CyTOF dataset achieving 90\% and 78\% cell-matching accuracy for each one of the samples, respectively.https://github.com/ratschlab/scim.Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

However, the interpretation and validation of these spaces remains a challenge. Here, we present scCoGAPS, which defines latent spaces from a source single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) dataset, and projectR, which evaluates these latent spaces in independent target datasets via transfer learning. Application of developing mouse retina to scRNA-Seq reveals intrinsic relationships across biological contexts and assays while avoiding batch effects and other technical features. We compare the dimensions learned in this source dataset to adult mouse retina, a time-course of human retinal development, select scRNA-seq datasets from developing brain, chromatin accessibility data, and a murine-cell type atlas to identify shared biological features. These tools lay the groundwork for exploratory analysis of scRNA-seq data via latent space representations, enabling a shift in how we compare and identify cells beyond reliance on marker genes or ensemble molecular identity.},

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a key cell signaling pathway involved in regulating cellular growth, proliferation, and survival. Driver mutations in the BRAF gene, a key player in the MAPK pathway, are described in multiple tumor types, including subsets of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), making BRAF a desirable target for inhibition. BRAF inhibitors have shown efficacy in several cancers; however, most patients eventually develop resistance. To delay or prevent resistance, combination therapy targeting BRAF and MEK, a downstream signaling target of BRAF in the MAPK pathway, was evaluated and demonstrated synergistic benefit. BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations have been approved for use in various cancers by the US FDA. We review the clinical data for various BRAF plus MEK combination regimens in three cancer types with underlying BRAF driver mutations: melanoma, NSCLC, and ATC. We also discuss practical treatment considerations and management of selected combination therapy toxicities.},

In particular, we extend the recent variational formulation of accelerated methods in (Wibisono et al., 2016) from vector valued variables to probability distributions. The variational problem is modeled as a mean-field optimal control problem. A quantitative estimate on the asymptotic convergence rate is provided based on a Lyapunov function construction, when the objective functional is displacement convex. An important special case is considered where the objective functional is the relative entropy. For this case, two numerical approximations are presented to implement the Hamilton’s equations as a system of N interacting particles. The algorithm is numerically illustrated and compared with the MCMC and Hamiltonian MCMC algorithms.},

Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30\,million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients.

This regularizer encourages the encoded training distribution to match the prior. We compare our algorithm with several other techniques and show that it is a generalization of adversarial auto-encoders (AAE). Our experiments show that WAE shares many of the properties of VAEs (stable training, encoder-decoder architecture, nice latent manifold structure) while generating samples of better quality, as measured by the FID score.}

Jointly learning from multi-modal data enables global integration of both shared and modality-specific information, but current strategies often fail when observa- tions from certain modalities are incomplete or missing for part of the subjects. To learn comprehensive representations based on such modality-incomplete data, we present a semi-supervised neural network model called CLUE (Cross-Linked Unified Embedding). Extending from multi-modal VAEs, CLUE introduces the use of cross-encoders to construct latent representations from modality-incomplete observations. Representation learning for modality-incomplete observations is common in genomics. For example, human cells are tightly regulated across multi- ple related but distinct modalities such as DNA, RNA, and protein, jointly defining a cell’s function. We benchmark CLUE on multi-modal data from single cell measurements, illustrating CLUE’s superior performance in all assessed categories of the NeurIPS 2021 Multimodal Single-cell Data Integration Competition. While we focus on analysis of single cell genomic datasets, we note that the proposed cross-linked embedding strategy could be readily applied to other cross-modality representation learning problems.},

  abstract = {The phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT and RAF/MEK/ERK signaling pathways are activated in a wide range of human cancers. In many cases, concomitant inhibition of both pathways is necessary to block proliferation and induce cell death and tumor shrinkage. Several feedback systems have been described in which inhibition of one intracellular pathway leads to activation of a parallel signaling pathway, thereby decreasing the effectiveness of single-agent targeted therapies. In this study, we describe a feedback mechanism in which MEK inhibition leads to activation of PI3K/AKT signaling in EGFR and HER2-driven cancers. We found that MEK inhibitor-induced activation of PI3K/AKT resulted from hyperactivation of ERBB3 as a result of the loss of an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation in the conserved juxtamembrane domains of EGFR and HER2. Mutation of this amino acid led to increased ERBB receptor activation and upregulation of the ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, which was no longer responsive to MEK inhibition. Taken together, these results elucidate an important, dominant feedback network regulating central oncogenic pathways in human cancer.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

Ex vivo approaches aim to embed biological relevance and inter-patient variability at an earlier stage of drug discovery, and to offer more precise treatment stratification for patients. However, these techniques also have a high potential to offer personalised therapies to patients, complementing and enhancing genomic medicine. Although an array of approaches are available to researchers, only a minority of techniques have made it through to direct patient treatment within robust clinical trials. Within this review, we discuss the current challenges to ex vivo approaches within clinical practice and summarise the contemporary literature which has directed patient treatment. Finally, we map out how ex vivo approaches could transition from a small-scale, predominantly research based technology to a robust and validated predictive tool. In future, these pre-clinical approaches may be integrated into clinical cancer pathways to assist in the personalisation of therapy choices and to hopefully improve patient experiences and outcomes.},

In this paper, we present a scalable method for unbalanced optimal transport (OT) based on the generative-adversarial framework. We formulate unbalanced OT as a problem of simultaneously learning a transport map and a scaling factor that push a source measure to a target measure in a cost-optimal manner. In addition, we propose an algorithm for solving this problem based on stochastic alternating gradient updates, similar in practice to GANs. We also provide theoretical justification for this formulation, showing that it is closely related to an existing static formulation by Liero et al. (2018), and perform numerical experiments demonstrating how this methodology can be applied to population modeling.},

  abstract = {The development of single-cell methods for capturing different data modalities including imaging and sequencing have revolutionized our ability to identify heterogeneous cell states. While various methods have been proposed to integrate different sequencing data modalities, coupling imaging and sequencing has been an open challenge. We here present an approach for integrating vastly different modalities by learning a probabilistic coupling between the different data modalities using autoencoders to map to a shared latent space. We validate this approach by integrating single-cell RNA-seq and chromatin images to identify distinct sub-populations of human naive CD4+ T-cells that are poised for activation. Collectively, our approach provides a framework to integrate and translate between data modalities that cannot yet be measured within the same cell for diverse applications in biomedical discovery.},

  abstract = {Lineage tracing involves the identification of all ancestors and descendants of a given cell, and is an important tool for studying biological processes such as development and disease progression. However, in many settings, controlled time-course experiments are not feasible, for example when working with tissue samples from patients. Here we present ImageAEOT, a computational pipeline based on autoencoders and optimal transport for predicting the lineages of cells using time-labeled datasets from different stages of a cellular process. Given a single-cell image from one of the stages, ImageAEOT generates an artificial lineage of this cell based on the population characteristics of the other stages. These lineages can be used to connect subpopulations of cells through the different stages and identify image-based features and biomarkers underlying the biological process. To validate our method, we apply ImageAEOT to a benchmark task based on nuclear and chromatin images during the activation of fibroblasts by tumor cells in engineered 3D tissues. We further validate ImageAEOT on chromatin images of various breast cancer cell lines and human tissue samples, thereby linking alterations in chromatin condensation patterns to different stages of tumor progression. Our results demonstrate the promise of computational methods based on autoencoding and optimal transport principles for lineage tracing in settings where existing experimental strategies cannot be used.},

  abstract = {Molecular alterations in cancer genes and associated signaling pathways are used to inform new treatments for precision medicine in cancer. Small molecule inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies directed at relevant cancer-related proteins have been instrumental in delivering successful treatments of some blood malignancies (e.g., imatinib with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)) and solid tumors (e.g., tamoxifen with ER positive breast cancer and trastuzumab for HER2-positive breast cancer). However, inherent limitations such as drug toxicity, as well as acquisition of de novo or acquired mechanisms of resistance, still cause treatment failure. Here we provide an up-to-date review of the successes and limitations of current targeted therapies for cancer treatment and highlight how recent technological advances have provided a new level of understanding of the molecular complexity underpinning resistance to cancer therapies. We also raise three basic questions concerning cancer drug discovery based on molecular markers and alterations of selected signaling pathways, and further discuss how combination therapies may become the preferable approach over monotherapy for cancer treatments. Finally, we consider novel therapeutic developments that may complement drug delivery and significantly improve clinical response and outcomes of cancer patients.},

  abstract = {Systematic perturbation of cells followed by comprehensive measurements of molecular and phenotypic responses provides informative data resources for constructing computational models of cell biology. Models that generalize well beyond training data can be used to identify combinatorial perturbations of potential therapeutic interest. Major challenges for machine learning on large biological datasets are to find global optima in a complex multidimensional space and mechanistically interpret the solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce a hybrid approach that combines explicit mathematical models of cell dynamics with a machine-learning framework, implemented in TensorFlow. We tested the modeling framework on a perturbation-response dataset of a melanoma cell line after drug treatments. The models can be efficiently trained to describe cellular behavior accurately. Even though completely data driven and independent of prior knowledge, the resulting de novo network models recapitulate some known interactions. The approach is readily applicable to various kinetic models of cell biology. A record of this paper’s Transparent Peer Review process is included in the Supplemental Information.},

  abstract = {Understanding how cells change their identity and behaviour in living systems is an important question in many fields of biology. The problem of inferring cell trajectories from single-cell measurements has been a major topic in the single-cell analysis community, with different methods developed for equilibrium and non-equilibrium systems (e.g. haematopoeisis vs. embryonic development). We show that optimal transport analysis, a technique originally designed for analysing time-courses, may also be applied to infer cellular trajectories from a single snapshot of a population in equilibrium. Therefore, optimal transport provides a unified approach to inferring trajectories that is applicable to both stationary and non-stationary systems. Our method, StationaryOT, is mathematically motivated in a natural way from the hypothesis of a Waddington’s epigenetic landscape. We implement StationaryOT as a software package and demonstrate its efficacy in applications to simulated data as well as single-cell data from Arabidopsis thaliana root development.},

We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ mRNA counting of tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation, of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6\,min, with ∼50\% cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system’s technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},
