  abstract = {We introduce the use of rectified linear units (ReLU) as the classification function in a deep neural network (DNN). Conventionally, ReLU is used as an activation function in DNNs, with Softmax function as their classification function. However, there have been several studies on using a classification function other than Softmax, and this study is an addition to those. We accomplish this by taking the activation of the penultimate layer \$h\_\{n - 1\}\$ in a neural network, then multiply it by weight parameters \$\textbackslash theta\$ to get the raw scores \$o\_\{i\}\$. Afterwards, we threshold the raw scores \$o\_\{i\}\$ by \$0\$, i.e. \$f(o) = \textbackslash max(0, o\_\{i\})\$, where \$f(o)\$ is the ReLU function. We provide class predictions \$\textbackslash hat\{y\}\$ through argmax function, i.e. argmax \$f(x)\$.},

  abstract = {The count table, a numeric matrix of genes\,×\,cells, is the basic input data structure in the analysis of single-cell RNA-sequencing data. A common preprocessing step is to adjust the counts for variable sampling efficiency and to transform them so that the variance is similar across the dynamic range. These steps are intended to make subsequent application of generic statistical methods more palatable. Here, we describe four transformation approaches based on the delta method, model residuals, inferred latent expression state and factor analysis. We compare their strengths and weaknesses and find that the latter three have appealing theoretical properties; however, in benchmarks using simulated and real-world data, it turns out that a rather simple approach, namely, the logarithm with a pseudo-count followed by principal-component analysis, performs as well or better than the more sophisticated alternatives. This result highlights limitations of current theoretical analysis as assessed by bottom-line performance benchmarks.},

These are scalar-valued (potentially deep) neural networks with constraints on the network parameters such that the output of the network is a convex function of (some of) the inputs. The networks allow for efficient inference via optimization over some inputs to the network given others, and can be applied to settings including structured prediction, data imputation, reinforcement learning, and others. In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many existing neural network architectures can be made input-convex with a minor modification, and develop specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.},

  abstract = {Malignant melanoma is notorious for its inter- and intratumour heterogeneity, based on transcriptionally distinct melanoma cell phenotypes. It is thought that these distinct phenotypes are plastic in nature and that their transcriptional reprogramming enables heterogeneous tumours both to undergo different stages of melanoma progression and to adjust to drug exposure during treatment. Recent advances in genomic technologies and the rapidly expanding availability of large gene expression datasets have allowed for a refined definition of the gene signatures that characterize these phenotypes and have revealed that phenotype plasticity plays a major role in the resistance to both targeted therapy and immunotherapy. In this Review we discuss the definition of melanoma phenotypes through particular transcriptional states and reveal the prognostic relevance of the related gene expression signatures. We review how the establishment of phenotypes is controlled and which roles phenotype plasticity plays in melanoma development and therapy. Because phenotype plasticity in melanoma bears a great resemblance to epithelial–mesenchymal transition, the lessons learned from melanoma will also benefit our understanding of other cancer types.},

  abstract = {A novel instrument for real time analysis of individual biological cells or other microparticles is described. The instrument is based on inductively coupled plasma time-of-flight mass spectrometry and comprises a three-aperture plasma-vacuum interface, a dc quadrupole turning optics for decoupling ions from neutral components, an rf quadrupole ion guide discriminating against low-mass dominant plasma ions, a point-to-parallel focusing dc quadrupole doublet, an orthogonal acceleration reflectron analyzer, a discrete dynode fast ion detector, and an 8-bit 1 GHz digitizer. A high spectrum generation frequency of 76.8 kHz provides capability for collecting multiple spectra from each particle-induced transient ion cloud, typically of 200-300 micros duration. It is shown that the transients can be resolved and characterized individually at a peak frequency of 1100 particles per second. Design considerations and optimization data are presented. The figures of merit of the instrument are measured under standard inductively coupled plasma (ICP) operating conditions ({$<$}3\% cerium oxide ratio). At mass resolution (full width at half-maximum) M/DeltaM {$>$} 900 for m/z = 159, the sensitivity with a standard sample introduction system of {$>$}1.4 x 10(8) ion counts per second per mg L(-1) of Tb and an abundance sensitivity of (6 x 10(-4))-(1.4 x 10(-3)) (trailing and leading masses, respectively) are shown. The mass range (m/z = 125-215) and abundance sensitivity are sufficient for elemental immunoassay with up to 60 distinct available elemental tags. When {$<$}15 elemental tags are used, a higher sensitivity mode at lower resolution (M/DeltaM {$>$} 500) can be used, which provides {$>$}2.4 x 10(8) cps per mg L(-1) of Tb, at (1.5 x 10(-3))-(5.0 x 10(-3)) abundance sensitivity. The real-time simultaneous detection of multiple isotopes from individual 1.8 microm polystyrene beads labeled with lanthanides is shown. A real time single cell 20 antigen expression assay of model cell lines and leukemia patient samples immuno-labeled with lanthanide-tagged antibodies is presented.},

We used single-cell "mass cytometry" to examine healthy human bone marrow, measuring 34 parameters simultaneously in single cells (binding of 31 antibodies, viability, DNA content, and relative cell size). The signaling behavior of cell subsets spanning a defined hematopoietic hierarchy was monitored with 18 simultaneous markers of functional signaling states perturbed by a set of ex vivo stimuli and inhibitors. The data set allowed for an algorithmically driven assembly of related cell types defined by surface antigen expression, providing a superimposable map of cell signaling responses in combination with drug inhibition. Visualized in this manner, the analysis revealed previously unappreciated instances of both precise signaling responses that were bounded within conventionally defined cell subsets and more continuous phosphorylation responses that crossed cell population boundaries in unexpected manners yet tracked closely with cellular phenotype. Collectively, such single-cell analyses provide system-wide views of immune signaling in healthy human hematopoiesis, against which drug action and disease can be compared for mechanistic studies and pharmacologic intervention.},

Starting from the basic requirements that inferred expression states should correct for both biological and measurement sampling noise and that changes in expression should be measured in terms of fold changes, we here derive a Bayesian normalization procedure called Sanity (SAmpling-Noise-corrected Inference of Transcription activitY) from first principles. Sanity estimates expression values and associated error bars directly from raw unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts without any tunable parameters. Using simulated and real scRNA-seq datasets, we show that Sanity outperforms other normalization methods on downstream tasks, such as finding nearest-neighbor cells and clustering cells into subtypes. Moreover, we show that by systematically overestimating the expression variability of genes with low expression and by introducing spurious correlations through mapping the data to a lower-dimensional representation, other methods yield severely distorted pictures of the data.},

Obtaining single-cell measurements typically requires the cells to be destroyed. This makes learning heterogeneous perturbation responses challenging as we only observe unpaired distributions of perturbed or non-perturbed cells. Here we leverage the theory of optimal transport and the recent advent of input convex neural architectures to present CellOT, a framework for learning the response of individual cells to a given perturbation by mapping these unpaired distributions. CellOT outperforms current methods at predicting single-cell drug responses, as profiled by scRNA-seq and a multiplexed protein-imaging technology. Further, we illustrate that CellOT generalizes well on unseen settings by (1) predicting the scRNA-seq responses of holdout patients with lupus exposed to interferon-β and patients with glioblastoma to panobinostat; (2) inferring lipopolysaccharide responses across different species; and (3) modeling the hematopoietic developmental trajectories of different subpopulations.},

Moreover, the reprogramming effect on immune cells is localized not only in the tumor but also at the systemic level. With wide application of single-cell sequencing technology, tumor-specific characteristics of immune cells and other stromal cells in the TME have been dissected.

Systematic benchmarking demonstrated that GLUE is more accurate, robust and scalable than state-of-the-art tools for heterogeneous single-cell multi-omics data. We applied GLUE to various challenging tasks, including triple-omics integration, integrative regulatory inference and multi-omics human cell atlas construction over millions of cells, where GLUE was able to correct previous annotations. GLUE features a modular design that can be flexibly extended and enhanced for new analysis tasks. The full package is available online at https://github.com/gao-lab/GLUE.},

A literature search was performed using MEDLINE/PubMed and scientific congress databases using the terms ‘BRAF,’ ‘mutation,’ and ‘cancer/tumor.’ These results were filtered to include manuscripts that focused on diagnostic tests for determining BRAF mutation status. Numerous BRAF testing methods were identified, including DNA-based companion diagnostic tests and DNA- and protein-based laboratory-developed tests. Herein we review the characteristics of each method and highlight the strengths and weaknesses that should be considered before use and when interpreting results for each patient. Molecular profiling has shown that mutation load increases with melanoma tumor progression and that unique patterns of genetic changes and evolutionary trajectories for different melanoma subtypes can occur. Discordance in the BRAF mutational status between primary and metastatic lesions, as well as intratumoral heterogeneity, is known to occur. Additionally, the development of acquired resistance to combination BRAF and MEK inhibitor therapy is still a formidable obstacle. Therefore, tumor heterogeneity and the development of acquired resistance have important implications for molecular testing and ultimately the treatment of patients with advanced-stage melanoma. Overall, this information may help community oncologists more accurately and effectively interpret results of diagnostic tests within the context of recent data characterizing melanoma tumor progression.},

Specifically, the combination of large-scale diverse datasets and pretrained transformers has emerged as a promising approach for developing foundation models. Drawing parallels between language and cellular biology (in which texts comprise words; similarly, cells are defined by genes), our study probes the applicability of foundation models to advance cellular biology and genetic research. Using burgeoning single-cell sequencing data, we have constructed a foundation model for single-cell biology, scGPT, based on a generative pretrained transformer across a repository of over 33 million cells. Our findings illustrate that scGPT effectively distills critical biological insights concerning genes and cells. Through further adaptation of transfer learning, scGPT can be optimized to achieve superior performance across diverse downstream applications. This includes tasks such as cell type annotation, multi-batch integration, multi-omic integration, perturbation response prediction and gene network inference.},

It is speculated that the frequency of brain metastasis is increasing for several reasons, including improved systemic therapy and survival, and detection of metastases in asymptomatic patients. The lack of preclinical models that recapitulate the clinical setting and the exclusion of patients with brain metastases from most clinical trials have slowed progress. Molecular factors contributing to brain metastases are being elucidated, such as genes involved in cell adhesion, extravasation, metabolism, and cellular signaling. Furthermore, the role of the unique brain microenvironment is beginning to be explored. Although the presence and function of the blood-brain barrier in metastatic tumors is still poorly understood, it is likely that some tumor cells are protected from therapeutics by the blood-tumor barrier, creating a sanctuary site. This Review discusses what is known about the biology of brain metastases, what preclinical models are available to study the disease, and which novel therapeutic strategies are being studied in patients.},

However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNA-seq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a negative binomial noise model with or without zero-inflation, and nonlinear gene-gene dependencies are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can, therefore, be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

We present two distribution-free tests based on large deviation bounds for the MMD, and a third test based on the asymptotic distribution of this statistic.  The MMD can be computed in quadratic time, although efficient linear time approximations are available.  Our statistic is an instance of an integral probability metric, and various classical metrics on distributions are obtained when alternative function classes are used in place of an RKHS.  We apply our two-sample tests  to a variety of problems, including attribute matching for databases using the Hungarian marriage method, where they perform strongly.  Excellent performance is also obtained when comparing distributions over graphs, for which these are the first such tests.},

  abstract = {Nearly all patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma will progress on BRAF inhibitor monotherapy and combination BRAF/MEK inhibitor therapy within the first year of therapy. In the vast majority of progressing melanomas, resistance occurs via the re-activation of MAPK signalling, commonly via alterations in BRAF, NRAS and MEK1/2. A small proportion of resistant melanomas rely on the activation of the compensatory PI3K/AKT signalling cascade, although activation of this pathway does not preclude patient responses to BRAF/MEK inhibition. We now show, that PI3K/AKT signalling via potent oncogenic PIK3CA and AKT3 mutants, is not sufficient to overcome proliferative arrest induced by BRAF/MEK inhibition, but rather enables the survival of a dormant population of MAPK-inhibited melanoma cells. The evolution of resistance in these surviving tumour cells was associated with MAPK re-activation and no longer depended on the initial PI3K/AKT-activating oncogene. This dynamic form of resistance alters signalling dependence and may lead to the evolution of tumour subclones highly resistant to multiple targeted therapies.},

However, assessing differential expression across multiple individuals has been hampered by inefficient sample processing and technical batch effects. Here we describe a computational tool, demuxlet, that harnesses natural genetic variation to determine the sample identity of each droplet containing a single cell (singlet) and detect droplets containing two cells (doublets). These capabilities enable multiplexed dscRNA-seq experiments in which cells from unrelated individuals are pooled and captured at higher throughput than in standard workflows. Using simulated data, we show that 50 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) per cell are sufficient to assign 97\% of singlets and identify 92\% of doublets in pools of up to 64 individuals. Given genotyping data for each of eight pooled samples, demuxlet correctly recovers the sample identity of {$>$}99\% of singlets and identifies doublets at rates consistent with previous estimates. We apply demuxlet to assess cell-type-specific changes in gene expression in 8 pooled lupus patient samples treated with interferon (IFN)-β and perform eQTL analysis on 23 pooled samples.},

The most common activating mutation present within the BRAF oncogene is associated with valine substitution for glutamate at position 600 (V600E) within the BRAF kinase. BRAF-targeted therapies are effective in patients with melanoma and NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation. In both melanoma and NSCLC, dual inhibition of both BRAF and the downstream mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) improves response rates compared with BRAF inhibition alone. BRAF-MEK combination therapy (dabrafenib plus trametinib) demonstrated tolerability and efficacy in a recent phase II clinical trial and was approved by the European Medicines Agency and United States Food and Drug Administration for patients with stage IV NSCLC harboring BRAF V600E mutation. Here, in this review, we outline the preclinical and clinical data for BRAF and MEK inhibitor combination treatment for NSCLC patients with BRAF V600E mutation.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

To promote the innovation of algorithms for analysis of multimodal single-cell data, we organized a competition at NeurIPS 2021 applying the Common Task Framework to multimodal single-cell data integration. For this competition we generated the first multimodal benchmarking dataset for single-cell biology and defined three tasks in this domain: prediction of missing modalities, aligning modalities, and learning a joint representation across modalities. We further specified evaluation metrics and developed a cloud-based algorithm evaluation pipeline. Using this setup, 280 competitors submitted over 2600 proposed solutions within a 3 month period, showcasing substantial innovation especially in the modality alignment task. Here, we present the results, describe trends of well performing approaches, and discuss challenges associated with running the competition.},

Here we conducted a prospective non-interventional trial to investigate feasibility of ex vivo drug response profiling for treatment guidance in hematologic malignancies (SMARTrial, NCT03488641 ). The primary endpoint to provide drug response profiling reports within 7\,d was met in 91\% of all study participants (N\,=\,80). Secondary endpoint analysis revealed that ex vivo resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs predicted chemotherapy treatment failure in vivo. We confirmed the predictive value of ex vivo response to chemotherapy in a validation cohort of 95 individuals with acute myeloid leukemia treated with daunorubicin and cytarabine. Ex vivo drug response profiles improved ELN-22 risk stratification in individuals with adverse risk. We conclude that ex vivo drug response profiling is clinically feasible and has the potential to predict chemotherapy response in individuals with hematologic malignancies beyond clinically established genetic markers.},

  abstract = {The key idea behind the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation which can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common assumptions. We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than 12000 models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks. Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering several data sets.},

Here, we present scGen (https://github.com/theislab/scgen), a model combining variational autoencoders and latent space vector arithmetics for high-dimensional single-cell gene expression data. We show that scGen accurately models perturbation and infection response of cells across cell types, studies and species. In particular, we demonstrate that scGen learns cell-type and species-specific responses implying that it captures features that distinguish responding from non-responding genes and cells. With the upcoming availability of large-scale atlases of organs in a healthy state, we envision scGen to become a tool for experimental design through in silico screening of perturbation response in the context of disease and drug treatment.},

As more analysis tools are becoming available, it is becoming increasingly difficult to navigate this landscape and produce an up‐to‐date workflow to analyse one's data. Here, we detail the steps of a typical single‐cell RNA‐seq analysis, including pre‐processing (quality control, normalization, data correction, feature selection, and dimensionality reduction) and cell‐ and gene‐level downstream analysis. We formulate current best‐practice recommendations for these steps based on independent comparison studies. We have integrated these best‐practice recommendations into a workflow, which we apply to a public dataset to further illustrate how these steps work in practice. Our documented case study can be found at https://www.github.com/theislab/single-cell-tutorial.

Several such normalization methods exist, some of which rely on spike-in genes, molecules added in known quantities to serve as a basis for a normalization model. Depending on available information and the type of data, some methods may express certain advantages over others. We compare the effectiveness of seven available normalization methods designed specifically for single-cell sequencing using two real data sets containing spike-in genes and one simulation study. Additionally, we test those methods not dependent on spike-in genes using a real data set with three distinct cell-cycle states and a real data set under the 10X Genomics GemCode platform with multiple cell types represented. We demonstrate the differences in effectiveness for the featured methods using visualization and classification assessment and conclude which methods are preferable for normalizing a certain type of data for further downstream analysis, such as classification or differential analysis.

  abstract = {A fundamental goal in cancer research is to understand the mechanisms of cell transformation. This is key to developing more efficient cancer detection methods and therapeutic approaches. One milestone towards this objective is the identification of all the genes with mutations capable of driving tumours. Since the 1970s, the list of cancer genes has been growing steadily. Because cancer driver genes are under positive selection in tumorigenesis, their observed patterns of somatic mutations across tumours in a cohort deviate from those expected from neutral mutagenesis. These deviations, which constitute signals of positive selection, may be detected by carefully designed bioinformatics methods, which have become the state of the art in the identification of driver genes. A systematic approach combining several of these signals could lead to a compendium of mutational cancer genes. In this Review, we present the Integrative OncoGenomics(IntOGen) pipeline, an implementation of such an approach to obtain the compendium of mutational cancer drivers. Its application to somatic mutations of more than 28,000 tumours of 66 cancer types reveals 568 cancer genes and points towards their mechanisms of tumorigenesis. The application of this approach to the ever-growing datasets of somatic tumour mutations will support the continuous refinement of our knowledge of the genetic basis of cancer.},

To assist the public health community in better serving these individuals, the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute collaborate triennially to estimate cancer prevalence in the United States using incidence and survival data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results cancer registries, vital statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics, and population projections from the US Census Bureau. Current treatment patterns based on information in the National Cancer Database are presented for the most prevalent cancer types by race, and cancer-related and treatment-related side-effects are also briefly described. More than 18 million Americans (8.3 million males and 9.7 million females) with a history of cancer were alive on January 1, 2022. The 3 most prevalent cancers are prostate (3,523,230), melanoma of the skin (760,640), and colon and rectum (726,450) among males and breast (4,055,770), uterine corpus (891,560), and thyroid (823,800) among females. More than one-half (53\%) of survivors were diagnosed within the past 10 years, and two-thirds (67\%) were aged 65 years or older. One of the largest racial disparities in treatment is for rectal cancer, for which 41\% of Black patients with stage I disease receive proctectomy or proctocolectomy compared to 66\% of White patients. Surgical receipt is also substantially lower among Black patients with non-small cell lung cancer, 49\% for stages I-II and 16\% for stage III versus 55\% and 22\% for White patients, respectively. These treatment disparities are exacerbated by the fact that Black patients continue to be less likely to be diagnosed with stage I disease than White patients for most cancers, with some of the largest disparities for female breast (53\% vs 68\%) and endometrial (59\% vs 73\%). Although there are a growing number of tools that can assist patients, caregivers, and clinicians in navigating the various phases of cancer survivorship, further evidence-based strategies and equitable access to available resources are needed to mitigate disparities for communities of color and optimize care for people with a history of cancer.

For a global view of IFN signatures and regulatory pathways, we performed gene expression and chromatin analyses of the IFN-induced response across a range of immunocyte lineages. These distinguished ISGs by cell-type specificity, kinetics, and sensitivity to tonic IFN, and revealed underlying changes in chromatin configuration. We combined 1398 human and mouse datasets to computationally infer ISG modules and their regulators, validated by genetic analysis in both species. Some ISGs are controlled by Stat1/2 and Irf9 and the ISRE DNA motif, but others appeared dependent on non-canonical factors. This regulatory framework helped to interpret JAK1 blockade pharmacology, different clusters being affected under tonic or IFN-stimulated conditions, and the IFN signatures previously associated with human diseases, revealing unrecognized subtleties in disease footprints, as affected by human ancestry.},

While less capable than humans in many real-world scenarios, GPT-4 exhibits human-level performance on various professional and academic benchmarks, including passing a simulated bar exam with a score around the top 10\% of test takers. GPT-4 is a Transformer-based model pre-trained to predict the next token in a document. The post-training alignment process results in improved performance on measures of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. A core component of this project was developing infrastructure and optimization methods that behave predictably across a wide range of scales. This allowed us to accurately predict some aspects of GPT-4's performance based on models trained with no more than 1/1,000th the compute of GPT-4.},

  abstract = {Paclitaxel is one of the most important lead compounds to emerge from a natural source. Because of the complex and unusual chemistry of paclitaxel, it is mainly extracted from the bark of a slow growing Western yew. Although total chemical synthesis of paclitaxel has been achieved, it may not be feasible commercially. Paclitaxel has a low therapeutic index: it is highly lipophilic and practically insoluble in water. The commercially available injection preparation is a sterile solution of the drug in Cremophor® EL and dehydrated alcohol. Present-day cancer chemotherapy with paclitaxel frequently causes hypersensitivity reactions. The major hurdles for successful therapy with paclitaxel are the availability of the drug and its delivery. The importance of developing an improved delivery system for paclitaxel is obvious from the problems seen from present-day therapy. Hence, the current approaches are mainly focused on: (1) developing formulations that are devoid of Cremophor® EL, (2) the possibility of large-scale preparation; and (3) stability for longer periods of time. The path to identify new molecules with better therapeutic efficacy will continue to be an integral part of health care systems, but the author is emphasizing the importance of `better delivery of drugs' which is going to further refine the therapy. The different approaches investigated so far have shown much promise in replacing the Cremophor® based vehicle for paclitaxel delivery. However, the final product for human use is still far away. Therefore this review is the first comprehensive account of the pharmaceutical aspects of paclitaxel, with special emphasis on its delivery.},

  abstract = {The tumor microenvironment (TME) is a critical regulator of tumor growth, progression, and metastasis. Since immune cells represent a large fraction of the TME, they play a key role in mediating pro- and anti-tumor immune responses. Immune escape, which suppresses anti-tumor immunity, enables tumor cells to maintain their proliferation and growth. Numerous mechanisms, which have been intensively studied in recent years, are involved in this process and based on these findings, novel immunotherapies have been successfully developed. Here, we review the composition of the TME and the mechanisms by which immune evasive processes are regulated. In detail, we describe membrane-bound and soluble factors, their regulation, and their impact on immune cell activation in the TME. Furthermore, we give an overview of the tumor/antigen presentation and how it is influenced under malignant conditions. Finally, we summarize novel TME-targeting agents, which are already in clinical trials for different tumor entities.},

  abstract = {Intrinsic cross-resistance to inhibition of different signaling pathways may hamper development of combinatorial treatments in melanoma, but the relative frequency of this phenotype and the strategies to overcome this hurdle remain poorly understood. Among 49 BRAF-mutant melanoma cell lines from patients not previously treated with target therapy, 21 (42.9\%) showed strong primary resistance (IC50 {$>$} 1 μM) to a BRAFV600E inhibitor. Most of the BRAF-inhibitor-resistant cell lines showed also strong or intermediate cross-resistance to MEK1/2- and to PI3K/mTOR-specific inhibitors. Primary cross-resistance was confirmed in an independent set of 23 BRAF-mutant short-term melanoma cell cultures. MEK1/2 and PI3K/mTOR co-targeting was the most effective approach, compared to BRAF and PI3K/mTOR dual blockade, to counteract primary resistance to BRAF inhibition and the cross-resistant phenotype. This was shown by extensive drug interaction analysis, tumor growth inhibition assays in-vivo, p-ERK and p-AKT inhibition, promotion of melanoma apoptosis, apoptosis-related protein modulation, activation of effector caspases and selective modulation of genes involved in melanoma drug resistance and belonging to the ERK/MAPK and PI3K/AKT canonical pathways. Compared to co-targeting of mutant BRAF and PI3K/mTOR, the association of a MEK1/2 and a PI3K/mTOR inhibitor was more effective in the activation of Bax and of caspase-3 and in the induction of caspase-dependent melanoma apoptosis. Furthermore Bax silencing reduced the latter effects. These results suggest that intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition is frequently associated with primary cross-resistance to MEK and PI3K/mTOR blockade in BRAF-mutant melanoma and provide pre-clinical evidence for a combinatorial approach to counteract this phenotype.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In patients affected by high-risk nonmuscle invasive bladder cancer (HR-NMIBC) progression to muscle invasive status is considered as the main indicator of local treatment failure. We aimed to investigate the effect of progression and time to progression on overall survival (OS) and to investigate their validity as surrogate endpoints. METHODS: A total of 1,510 patients from 18 different institutions treated for T1 high grade NMIBC, followed by a secondary transurethral resection and BCG intravesical instillation. We relied on random survival forest (RSF) to rank covariates based on OS prediction. Cox's regression models were used to quantify the effect of covariates on mortality. RESULTS: During a median follow-up of 49.0 months, 485 (32.1\%) patients progressed to MIBC, while 163 (10.8\%) patients died. The median time to progression was 82 (95\%CI: 78.0-93.0) months. In RSF time-to-progression and age were the most predictive covariates of OS. The survival tree defined 5 groups of risk. In multivariable Cox's regression models accounting for progression status as time-dependent covariate, shorter time to progression (as continuous covariate) was associated with longer OS (HR: 9.0, 95\%CI: 3.0-6.7; P {$<$} 0.001). Virtually same results after time to progression stratification (time to progression ≥10.5 months as reference). CONCLUSION: Time to progression is the main predictor of OS in patients with high risk NMIBC treated with BCG and might be considered a coprimary endpoint. In addition, models including time to progression could be considered for patients' stratification in clinical practice and at the time of clinical trials design.},

Because of the low amount of RNA present in a single cell, some genes may fail to be detected even though they are expressed; these genes are usually referred to as dropouts. Here, we present a general and flexible zero-inflated negative binomial model (ZINB-WaVE), which leads to low-dimensional representations of the data that account for zero inflation (dropouts), over-dispersion, and the count nature of the data. We demonstrate, with simulated and real data, that the model and its associated estimation procedure are able to give a more stable and accurate low-dimensional representation of the data than principal component analysis (PCA) and zero-inflated factor analysis (ZIFA), without the need for a preliminary normalization step.},

To overcome these crucial limitations, we here introduced scConfluence, a novel method for single-cell diagonal integration. scConfluence combines uncoupled autoencoders on the complete set of features with regularized Inverse Optimal Transport on weakly connected features. We extensively benchmark scConfluence in several single-cell integration scenarios proving that it outperforms the state-of-the-art. We then demonstrate the biological relevance of scConfluence in three applications. We predict spatial patterns for Scgn, Synpr and Olah in scRNA-smFISH integration. We improve the classification of B cells and Monocytes in highly heterogeneous scRNA-scATAC-CyTOF integration. Finally, we reveal the joint contribution of Fezf2 and apical dendrite morphology in Intra Telencephalic neurons, based on morphological images and scRNA.},

  abstract = {Gene mutations can induce cellular alteration and malignant transformation. Development of many types of cancer is associated with mutations in the B-raf proto-oncogene (BRAF) gene. The encoded protein is a component of the mitogen-activated protein kinases/extracellular signal-regulated kinases (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathway, transmitting information from the outside to the cell nucleus. The main function of the MAPK/ERK pathway is to regulate cell growth, migration, and proliferation. The most common mutations in the BRAF gene encode the V600E mutant (class I), which causes continuous activation and signal transduction, regardless of external stimulus. Consequently, cell proliferation and invasion are enhanced in cancer patients with such mutations. The V600E mutation has been linked to melanoma, colorectal cancer, multiple myeloma, and other types of cancers. Importantly, emerging evidence has recently indicated that new types of mutations (classes II and III) also play a paramount role in the development of cancer. In this minireview, we discuss the influence of various BRAF mutations in cancer, including aberrant transcriptional gene regulation in the affected tissues.},

  abstract = {Background BRAF mutations are a common finding in malignant melanoma (MM). Nevertheless, apart from their significance as a therapeutic target in advanced melanoma, their prognostic value is still debated. Objective To assess BRAF mutation status in primary, recurrent, or metastatic MM and its correlations with histopathological findings. Methods We analyzed 203 samples from 178 consecutive patients: 129 primary cutaneous MM, 49 metastatic and recurrent MM of unknown primary site, and 25 cases of recurrences or metastases of primary MM. BRAF mutations in exon 15 were identified with real-time polymerase chain reaction and/or direct sequencing or pyrosequencing. Histopathological examination was performed according to standard procedures. Results We observed a 42.1\% prevalence of BRAF mutations at codon 600 among our patients, 84\% of whom harbored the V600E mutation. Mutations showed a statistically significant increase in younger patients (P = 0.011), in ulcerated tumors (P = 0.020), and in tumors lacking solar elastosis in adjacent dermis (P = 0.008). Mutations were also more common in male patients, as well as in primary MMs of the torso, and in nonvisceral metastases, however without reaching statistical significance. Logistic regression analysis identified type and ulceration as the only significant predictors of BRAF mutation. The highest frequencies of mutated BRAF were identified in superficial spreading and nodular types, and the lowest in acral lentiginous and lentigo maligna types. In situ MM and primary dermal melanoma displayed intermediate frequencies. Conclusion Frequency of mutated BRAF is type-related and correlated with ulceration, a known adverse prognostic factor.},

Here, we introduce “sci-Plex,” which uses “nuclear hashing” to quantify global transcriptional responses to thousands of independent perturbations at single-cell resolution. As a proof of concept, we applied sci-Plex to screen three cancer cell lines exposed to 188 compounds. In total, we profiled \textasciitilde 650,000 single-cell transcriptomes across \textasciitilde 5000 independent samples in one experiment. Our results reveal substantial intercellular heterogeneity in response to specific compounds, commonalities in response to families of compounds, and insight into differential properties within families. In particular, our results with histone deacetylase inhibitors support the view that chromatin acts as an important reservoir of acetate in cancer cells.},

They involve tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription factors by Janus tyrosine kinases at the cell membrane, followed by release of signal transducers and activators of transcription and their migration to the nucleus, where they induce the expression of the many gene products that determine the responses. Ancillary pathways are also activated by the interferons, but their effects on cell physiology are less clear. The Janus kinases and signal transducers and activators of transcription, and many of the interferon-induced proteins, play important alternative roles in cells, raising interesting questions as to how the responses to the interferons intersect with more general aspects of cellular physiology and how the specificity of cytokine responses is maintained.},

The mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is a key cell signaling pathway involved in regulating cellular growth, proliferation, and survival. Driver mutations in the BRAF gene, a key player in the MAPK pathway, are described in multiple tumor types, including subsets of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC), making BRAF a desirable target for inhibition. BRAF inhibitors have shown efficacy in several cancers; however, most patients eventually develop resistance. To delay or prevent resistance, combination therapy targeting BRAF and MEK, a downstream signaling target of BRAF in the MAPK pathway, was evaluated and demonstrated synergistic benefit. BRAF and MEK inhibitor combinations have been approved for use in various cancers by the US FDA. We review the clinical data for various BRAF plus MEK combination regimens in three cancer types with underlying BRAF driver mutations: melanoma, NSCLC, and ATC.

  abstract = {Mapping gene networks requires large amounts of transcriptomic data to learn the connections between genes, which impedes discoveries in settings with limited data, including rare diseases and diseases affecting clinically inaccessible tissues. Recently, transfer learning has revolutionized fields such as natural language understanding1,2 and computer vision3 by leveraging deep learning models pretrained on large-scale general datasets that can then be fine-tuned towards a vast array of downstream tasks with limited task-specific data. Here, we developed a context-aware, attention-based deep learning model, Geneformer, pretrained on a large-scale corpus of about 30\,million single-cell transcriptomes to enable context-specific predictions in settings with limited data in network biology. During pretraining, Geneformer gained a fundamental understanding of network dynamics, encoding network hierarchy in the attention weights of the model in a completely self-supervised manner. Fine-tuning towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks relevant to chromatin and network dynamics using limited task-specific data demonstrated that Geneformer consistently boosted predictive accuracy. Applied to disease modelling with limited patient data, Geneformer identified candidate therapeutic targets for cardiomyopathy. Overall, Geneformer represents a pretrained deep learning model from which fine-tuning towards a broad range of downstream applications can be pursued to accelerate discovery of key network regulators and candidate therapeutic targets.},

  abstract = {Multi-modal learning is essential for understanding information in the real world. Jointly learning from multi-modal data enables global integration of both shared and modality-specific information, but current strategies often fail when observa- tions from certain modalities are incomplete or missing for part of the subjects. To learn comprehensive representations based on such modality-incomplete data, we present a semi-supervised neural network model called CLUE (Cross-Linked Unified Embedding). Extending from multi-modal VAEs, CLUE introduces the use of cross-encoders to construct latent representations from modality-incomplete observations. Representation learning for modality-incomplete observations is common in genomics. For example, human cells are tightly regulated across multi- ple related but distinct modalities such as DNA, RNA, and protein, jointly defining a cell’s function. We benchmark CLUE on multi-modal data from single cell measurements, illustrating CLUE’s superior performance in all assessed categories of the NeurIPS 2021 Multimodal Single-cell Data Integration Competition. While we focus on analysis of single cell genomic datasets, we note that the proposed cross-linked embedding strategy could be readily applied to other cross-modality representation learning problems.},

Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.},

However, inherent limitations such as drug toxicity, as well as acquisition of de novo or acquired mechanisms of resistance, still cause treatment failure. Here we provide an up-to-date review of the successes and limitations of current targeted therapies for cancer treatment and highlight how recent technological advances have provided a new level of understanding of the molecular complexity underpinning resistance to cancer therapies. We also raise three basic questions concerning cancer drug discovery based on molecular markers and alterations of selected signaling pathways, and further discuss how combination therapies may become the preferable approach over monotherapy for cancer treatments.

  abstract = {Characterizing the transcriptome of individual cells is fundamental to understanding complex biological systems. We describe a droplet-based system that enables 3′ mRNA counting of tens of thousands of single cells per sample. Cell encapsulation, of up to 8 samples at a time, takes place in ∼6\,min, with ∼50\% cell capture efficiency. To demonstrate the system’s technical performance, we collected transcriptome data from ∼250k single cells across 29 samples. We validated the sensitivity of the system and its ability to detect rare populations using cell lines and synthetic RNAs. We profiled 68k peripheral blood mononuclear cells to demonstrate the system’s ability to characterize large immune populations. Finally, we used sequence variation in the transcriptome data to determine host and donor chimerism at single-cell resolution from bone marrow mononuclear cells isolated from transplant patients.},
