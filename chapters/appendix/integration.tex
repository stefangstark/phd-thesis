        The top panel shows the negative log-likelihood of the CyTOF reconstruction.
        The middle panel shows the performance of the discriminator to correctly classify scRNA codes (critic-prior), CyTOF codes (critic-code), and the ability of the encoder to fool the discriminator, i.e., the misclassification accuracy (generator).
        The bottom panel shows the divergence of the latent representations.
        The model is able to converge quickly.
However, the divergence score can fluctuate despite still fooling the discriminator.

    Fraction censored is the fraction of labels removed during training.
    The top 4 configurations for each level of semi-supervision is shown.
    $\beta$ is the regularization strength of the adversarial loss.
    Learning rates are the initial settings of the ADAM optimizer.
    If the latent space divergence is below 0.3 and
    the negative log-likelihood of the input under the reconstruction is below 47,
    the training is determined to be a success. These values were chosen empirically.
    We see that $\beta$ and optimizer learning rates were heavily influential on model success.
