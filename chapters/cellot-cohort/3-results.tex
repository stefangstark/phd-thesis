Mykokig behaves as an outlier as it has much more cells per treatment than other samples and these cells have low variance in their intensity features.
  b) Morphology features of mykokig cells indicate the presence of artifacts. The cluster map shows the distribution of each extracted morphology feature (rows) for cells sampled from mykokig and a subset of 5 samples from the full cohort. A large fraction of mykokig cells exhibit a strange unique morphology pattern of small round cells.

In order to simulate the clinic environment, we construct, for each patient, a training set composed of all other patients in the cohort (Fig\ref{fig:ood-main}a).
Then, for each perturbation available,
we train a model on the control and treated cells across the whole observed cohort
and apply this model to predict the responses of the unseen patient.
We then evaluate the set of predicted cellular states against the unseen treated cells of the held out patient, as we had done in the iid case.
In addition to the MMD metric, which considers the state of a multi-dimensional cellular feature set,
we also report the Earth Moverâ€™s Distance (EMD) of the marker feature of each perturbation.
The marker feature is selected by computing the EMD of the observed control and treated states and selecting the feature with the highest average distance,
i.e. the feature that was most affected by the perturbation.
For instance, for trametinib, this feature is pERK.
The marker feature is of particular interest to the clinician as this typically corresponds to the cellular pathways the treatment is designed to control.

Within each treatment, we compare the ability of CellOT to consistently improve predictions of heldout samples across the whole cohort against baseline approaches.
Fig\ref{fig:ood-main}b shows for which treatments there are significant differences across the whole cohort between
the metric reported by CellOT and the baseline approach, as measured by a relative t-test (p-value < 0.01).
The full distributions for the differences of these metrics can be found in Figures \ref{fig:ood-eval-logmmd} and \ref{fig:ood-eval-marker}.
We demonstrate that we are able to make strong gains in many perturbation settings, including most of the targeted therapies.
These therapies are of particular interest as they are among some of the most commonly administered treatments \cite{} and, in addition, tend to have the strongest effects.
Many other treatments tend to have more subtle effects, wherein individual effects can dominate the response and thus generalization is difficult to attain.
However, CellOT rarely underperforms against the baselines, and in the few cases when it does, it does so with small effect sizes.
Note that while scGen tends to capture the response of a particular marker feature (EMD metric), it struggles to capture realistic cellular states (MMD metric), while the other baseline methods have the inverse behavior.
CellOT is able to offer the best of both, highlighting its robustness and stability.
We furthermore provide some example marginals (Fig\ref{fig:ood-main}c, full set in Supplemental Fig \ref{}), showcasing how CellOT is able to learn biologically relevant states.
We include the MMD metric corresponding to the selected CellOT predictions, to give a general indication of how well the model is performing.

Finally, for some treatments, we observed strongly differential responses across the cohort.
This is in particular true for some types of targeted therapies which are intended to be prescribed for patients with specific driver mutations.
In the case of dabrafenib, we see such a strongly differential structure in the responses across the cohort.
Fig\ref{fig:ood-main}d) reports a dendrogram computed over the pairwise similarities over the set of each patientâ€™s individual CellOT responses, computed as in Fig 4a, where a strong clustering of BRAF v600 patients is observed.
We then train a version of CellOT with conditional parameters \cite{} able to inform and influence its learned responses with clinical metadata, Fig\ref{fig:ood-main}e.
We condition on both driver mutation status as well as the number of lines of treatment.
While we trained this model across all treatments and holdout patients,
CellOT was already able to capture such differential response behavior and the added conditional parameters did not improve its performance.
Marginals highlighting the differential response behavior are shown in Fig\ref{fig:ood-main}f, where it can been seen that conditional CellOT better learns that mekakyd, a sample without the driver mutation, has a minimal response to dabrafenib, while the stronger response of modulol, a BRAF v600 positive patient, is captured, see Supplemental Fig X for a more indepth analysis.


\subsection{Future progression status of incoming samples}
In this experiment we demonstrate the clinical utility of predicting single-cell perturbation responses of incoming patients.
We aim to understand if we can predict whether a patient will progress within 90 days using predicted single-cell responses, i.e. without access to treated cell states.
To ensure that we select treatments that are relevant to the situation of individual patients, we limit ourselves to the treatments that had been prescribed to samples by the medical board associated with the Tumor Profiler project.
From the total cohort, 22 samples had been prescribed small molecule treatments.
Of these 22, we removed three samples due to quality control: mykokig, had evidence of unfiltered artifacts in its observed treated cells \ref{}, \textsc{motamuh}, as it represents an extreme outlier in IID and OOD response prediction tasks \ref{} , and \textsc{mecygyr}, as it had showed evidence of immediate progression at the start of the study ( < 5 days).
We simulate the clinic environment by splitting the patients into a train (75\%) and test (25\%) set, wherein we have access to the control and treated cells of all patients in the training set, and only have access to control cells of patients in the testset.

Our prediction model works as follows: first, single-cell responses are clustered and patients are represented as frequencies over these clusters, and then an SVM classification model is trained to predict the binary progression status using the patient representations.
To construct the patient representations of the training set, a KMeans clustering is computed using the single-cell treatment responses from all patients in the training set, as predicted using the IID CellOT models \ref{}.
We perform a soft assignment of each cell to the k cluster centers, via a softmax transformation over the negative distances to each cluster center, to smooth cluster assignments and help include a notion of cluster similarities.
After this step, each cell is now represented as a probability over the set of cluster centers.
A patient-level representation is constructed by averaging the cluster assignments over all cells in each patient.
For test set patients, since we assume we do not have access to treated cell states, we use the OOD CellOT predictions instead of the IID predictions.

Since this is a balanced classification task, we report accuracy as our metric and consider 50\% a trivial lower bound.
For each model setting we perform 100 75\%-25\% train-test splits, i.e. in each split, 4 of the 19 samples are heldout.
We include a model that predicts the progression stats at 90 days with meta information at the sample level, specifically a random forest over the subtype, lines of treatment, and known driver mutation, represented as the concatenation over one-hot encodings of each category.
We furthermore compare our approach to a similar approach that uses predicted treated states, control cells, and single-cell responses predicted by the baselines \ref{}.
