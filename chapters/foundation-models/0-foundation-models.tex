\section{Outlook}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the methods discussed in this thesis are reliant on learning good representations
  \item single-cell foundation models are emerging following success in nlp, chatgpt etc
  \item low-data regime, reliance on "correct" models
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Review attention mechanism, transformers}
\subsection{Review of current approaches to single-cell foundation models}
\subsection{pmVAE, encoding biological priors in latent space}
